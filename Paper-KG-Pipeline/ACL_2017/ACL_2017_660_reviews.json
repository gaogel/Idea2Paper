    "comments": "The paper presents two approaches for generating English poetry. The first approach combine a neural phonetic encoder predicting the next phoneme with a phonetic-orthographic HMM decoder computing the most likely word corresponding to a sequence of phonemes. The second approach combines a character language model with a weigthed FST to impose rythm constraints on the output of the language model. For the second approach, the authors also present a heuristic approach which permit constraining the generated poem according to theme (e.g;, love) or poetic devices (e.g., alliteration). The generated poems are evaluated both instrinsically by comparing the rythm of the generated lines with a gold standard and extrinsically by asking 70 human evaluators to (i) determine whether the poem was written by a human or a machine and (ii) rate poems wrt to readability, form and evocation.  The results indicate that the second model performs best and that human evaluators find it difficult to distinguish between human written and machine generated poems.\nThis is an interesting, clearly written article with novel ideas (two different models for poetry generation, one based on a phonetic language model the other on a character LM) and convincing results.\n For the evaluation, more precision about the evaluators and the protocol would be good. Did all evaluators evaluate all poems and if not how many judgments were collected for each poem for each task ? You mention 9 non English native speakers. Poems are notoriously hard to read. How fluent were these ?  In the second model (character based), perhaps I missed it, but do you have a mechanism to avoid generating non words ? If not, how frequent are non words in the generated poems ?\nIn the first model, why use an HMM to transliterate from phonetic to an orhographic representation rather than a CRF?  Since overall, you rule out the first model as a good generic model for generating poetry, it might have been more interesting to spend less space on that model and more on the evaluation of the second model. In particular, I would have been interested in a more detailed discussion of the impact of the heuristic you use to constrain theme or poetic devices. How do these impact evaluation results ? Could they be combined to jointly constrain theme and poetic devices ?  The combination of a neural mode with a WFST is reminiscent of the following paper which combine character based neural model to generate from dialog acts with an WFST to avoid generating non words. YOu should relate your work to theirs and cite them.

    "strengths": "Good procedure for generating rhythmic poetry.\nProposals for adding control of theme and poetic devices (alliteration, consonance, asonance).\nStrong results in evaluation of rhythm.",
    "weaknesses": "Poor coverage of existing literature on poetry generation.\nNo comparison with existing approaches to poetry generation.\nNo evaluation of results on theme and poetic devices.",
    "comments": "The introduction describes the problem of poetry generation as divided into two subtasks: the problem of content (the poem's semantics) and the problem of form (the  aesthetic rules the poem follows). The solutions proposed in the paper address both of these subtasks in a limited fashion. They rely on neural networks trained over corpora  of poetry (represented at the phonetic or character level, depending on the solution) to encode the linguistic continuity of the outputs. This does indeed ensure that the  outputs resemble meaningful text. To say that this is equivalent to having found a way of providing the poem with appropriate semantics would be an overstatement. The  problem of form can be said to be addressed for the case of rhythm, and partial solutions are proposed for some poetic devices. Aspects of form concerned with structure at a  larger scale (stanzas and rhyme schemes) remain beyond the proposed solutions. \nNevertheless, the paper constitutes a valuable effort in the advancement of poetry generation.\nThe review of related work provided in section 2 is very poor. It does not even cover the set of previous efforts that the authors themselves consider worth mentioning in their paper (the work of Manurung et al 2000 and Misztal and Indurkhya 2014 is cited later in the paper - page 4 - but it is not placed in section 2 with respect to the other authors mentioned there).\nA related research effort of particular relevance that the authors should consider is: - Gabriele Barbieri, François Pachet, Pierre Roy, and Mirko Degli Esposti. \n2012. Markov constraints for generating lyrics with style. In Proceedings of the 20th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'12), Luc De Raedt, Christian Bessiere, Didier Dubois, Patrick Doherty, and Paolo Frasconi (Eds.). IOS Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, The Netherlands, 115-120. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-115 This work addresses very similar problems to those discussed in the present paper (n-gram based generation and the problem of driving generation process with additional constraints). The authors should include a review of this work and discuss the similarities and differences with their own.\nAnother research effort that is related to what the authors are attempting (and has bearing on their evaluation process) is: - Stephen McGregor, Matthew Purver and Geraint Wiggins, Process Based Evaluation of Computer Generated Poetry,  in: Proceedings of the INLG 2016 Workshop on Computational Creativity and Natural Language Generation, pages 51–60,Edinburgh, September 2016.c2016 Association for Computational Linguistics This work is also similar to the current effort in that it models language initially at a phonological level, but considers a word n-gram level superimposed on that, and also features a layer representint sentiment. Some of the considerations McGregor et al make on evaluation of computer generated poetry are also relevant for the extrinsic evaluation described in the present paper.\nAnother work that I believe should be considered is: - \"Generating Topical Poetry\" (M. Ghazvininejad, X. Shi, Y. Choi, and K. Knight), Proc. EMNLP, 2016.\nThis work generates iambic pentameter by combining finite-state machinery with deep learning. It would be interesting to see how the proposal in the current paper constrasts with this particular approach.\nAlthough less relevant to the present paper, the authors should consider extending their classification of poetry generation systems (they mention rule-based expert systems and statistical approaches) to include evolutionary solutions. They already mention in their paper the work of Manurung, which is evolutionary in nature, operating over TAG grammars.\nIn any case, the paper as it stands holds little to no effort of comparison to prior approaches to poetry generation. The authors should make an effort to contextualise their work with respect to previous efforts, specially in the case were similar problems are being addressed (Barbieri et al, 2012) or similar methods are being applied (Ghazvininejad,  et al, 2016).",
