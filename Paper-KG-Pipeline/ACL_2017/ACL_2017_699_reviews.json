    "strengths": "The paper is well-organized and easy to follow (the intuition of the proposed method is clear). It includes enough details to replicate experiments. Although the application of an encoder-decoder (+ copy mechanism) is straightforward, experimental results are reasonable and support the claim (generation of absent keyphrases) presented in this paper.",
    "weaknesses": "As said above, there is little surprise in the proposed approach. Also, as described in Section 5.3, the trained model does not transfer well to new domain (it goes below unsupervised models). One of the contribution of this paper is to maintain training corpora in good quantity and quality, but it is not (explicitly) stated.",
    "comments": "I like to read the paper and would be pleased to see it accepted. I would like to know how the training corpus (size and variation) affects the performance of the proposed method. Also, it would be beneficial to see the actual values of p_g and p_c (along with examples in Figure 1) in the CopyRNN model. From my experience in running the CopyNet, the copying mechanism sometimes works unexpectedly (not sure why this happens).",

    "strengths": "1. The formation and extraction of key phrases, which are absent in the current document is an interesting idea of significant research interests.  2. The paper is easily understandable.\n3. The use of RNN and Copy RNN in the current context is a new idea. As, deep recurrent neural networks are already used in keyphrase extraction (shows very good performance also), so, it will be interesting to have a proper motivation to justify the use of  RNN and Copy RNN over deep recurrent neural networks.",
    "weaknesses": "1. Some discussions are required on the convergence of the proposed joint learning process (for RNN and CopyRNN), so that readers can understand, how the stable points in probabilistic metric space are obtained? Otherwise, it may be tough to repeat the results.\n2. The evaluation process shows that the current system (which extracts 1. \nPresent and 2. Absent both kinds of keyphrases) is evaluated against baselines (which contains only \"present\" type of keyphrases). Here there is no direct comparison of the performance of the current system w.r.t. other state-of-the-arts/benchmark systems on only \"present\" type of key phrases. It is important to note that local phrases (keyphrases) are also important for the document. The experiment does not discuss it explicitly. It will be interesting to see the impact of the RNN and Copy RNN based model on automatic extraction of local or \"present\" type of key phrases.\n3. The impact of document size in keyphrase extraction is also an important point. It is found that the published results of [1], (see reference below) performs better than (with a sufficiently high difference) the current system on Inspec (Hulth, 2003) abstracts dataset.  4. It is reported that current system uses 527,830 documents for training, while 40,000 publications are held out for training baselines. Why are all publications not used in training the baselines? Additionally,        The topical details of the dataset (527,830 scientific documents) used in training RNN and Copy RNN are also missing. This may affect the chances of repeating results.\n5. As the current system captures the semantics through RNN based models. So, it would be better to compare this system, which also captures semantics. Even, Ref-[2] can be a strong baseline to compare the performance of the current system.\nSuggestions to improve: 1. As, per the example, given in the Figure-1, it seems that all the \"absent\" type of key phrases are actually \"Topical phrases\". For example: \"video search\", \"video retrieval\", \"video indexing\" and \"relevance ranking\", etc. \nThese all define the domain/sub-domain/topics of the document. So, In this case, it will be interesting to see the results (or will be helpful in evaluating \"absent type\" keyphrases): if we identify all the topical phrases of the entire corpus by using tf-idf and relate the document to the high-ranked extracted topical phrases (by using Normalized Google Distance, PMI, etc.). As similar efforts are already applied in several query expansion techniques (with the aim to relate the document with the query, if matching terms are absent in document).\nReference: 1.

    "strengths": "Novel model.  I particularly like the ability to generate keyphrases not present in the source text.",
    "weaknesses": "Needs to be explicit whether all evaluated models are trained and tested on the same data sets.  Exposition of the copy mechanism not quite clear/convincing.",
    "comments": "This paper presents a supervised neural network approach for keyphrase generation.  The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture that first encodes input text with a RNN, then uses an attention mechanism to generate keyphrases from the hidden states.  There is also a more advanced variant of the decoder which has an attention mechanism that conditions on the keyphrase generated in the previous time step.\nThe model is interesting and novel. And I think the ability to generate keyphrases not in the source text is particularly appealing.  My main concern is with the evaluation:  Are all evaluated models trained with the same amount of data and evaluated on the same test sets?              It's not very clear.  For example, on the NUS data set, Section 4.2 line 464 says that the supervised baselines are evaluated with cross validation.\nOther comments: The paper is mostly clearly written and easy to follow.  However, some parts are unclear: - Absent keyphrases vs OOV.  I think there is a need to distinguish   between the two, and the usage meaning of OOV should be consistent.  The RNN models   use the most frequent 50000 words as the vocabulary (Section 3.4   line 372, Section 5.1 line 568), so I suppose OOV are words not in   this 50K vocabulary.              In line 568, do you mean OOV or absent   words/keyphrases?  Speaking of this, I'm wondering how many   keyphrases fall outside of this 50K?              The use of \"unknown words\"   in line 380 is also ambiguous.  I think it's probably clearer to say that  the RNN models can generate words not present in the source text as long as they appear somewhere else in the corpus (and the 50K vocabulary) - Exposition of the copy mechanism (section 3.4).  This mechanism has a   more specific locality than the attention model in basic RNN model. \n  However, I find the explanation of the intuition misleading.              If I   understand correctly, the \"copy mechanism\" is conditioned on the   source text locations that matches the keyphrase in the previous   time step y_{t-1}.  So maybe it has a higher tendency to generate n-grams seen source text (Figure 1).  I buy the argument that the more sophisticated   attention model probably makes CopyRNN better than the RNN   overall, but why is the former model particularly better for absent   keyphrases?  It is as if both models perform equally well on present keyphrases.\n- How are the word embeddings initialized?",
