    "comments": "In this paper the authors present a method for directly querying Wikipedia to answer open domain questions. The system consist of two components - a module to query/fetch wikipedia articles and a module to answer the question given the fetched set of wikipedia articles.  The document retrieval system is a traditional IR system relying on term frequency models and ngram counts.  The answering system uses a feature representation for paragraphs that consists of word embeddings, indicator features to determine whether a paragraph word occurs in a question, token-level features including POS, NER etc and a soft feature for capturing similarity between question and paragraph tokens in embedding space. A combined feature representation is used as an input to a bi-direction LSTM RNN for encoding. For questions an RNN that works on the word embeddings is used. \nThese are then used to train an overall classifier independently for start and end spans of sentences within a paragraph to answer questions.\nThe system has been trained using different Open Domain QA datasets such as SQuAD and WebQuestions by modifying the training data to include articles fetched by the IR engine instead of just the actual correct document/passage.\nOverall, an easy to follow interesting paper but I had a few questions: 1) The IR system has a Accuracy@5 of over 75 %, and individually the document reader performs well and can beat the best single models on SquAD. What explains the significant drop in Table 6. The authors mention that instead of the fetched results, if they test using the best paragraph the accuracy reaches just 0.49 (from 0.26) but that is still significantly below the 0.78-79 in the SQuAD task.  So, presumably the error is this large because the neural network for matching isnt doing as good a job in learning the answers when using the modified training set (which includes fetched articles) instead of the case when training and testing is done for the document understanding task. Some analysis of whats going on here should be provided. What was the training accuracy in the both cases? What can be done to improve it? To be fair, the authors to allude to this in the conclusion but I think it still needs to be part of the paper to provide some meaningful insights.\n2) I understand the authors were interested in treating this as a pure machine comprehension task and therefore did not want to rely on external sources such as Freebase which could have helped with entity typing        but that would have been interesting to use. Tying back to my first question -- if the error is due to highly relevant topical sentences as the authors mention, could entity typing have helped?\nThe authors should also refer to QuASE (Sun et. al 2015 at WWW2015) and similar systems in their related work. QuASE is also an Open domain QA system that answers using fetched passages - but it relies on the web instead of just Wikipedia.",

    "paper_summary": "",
    "strengths": "The authors focus on a very challenging task of answering open-domain question from Wikipedia. Authors have developed 1) a document retriever to retrieve relevant Wikipedia articles for a question, and 2) Document retriever to retrieve the exact answer from the retrieved paragraphs. \nAuthors used Distant Supervision to fine-tune their model. Experiments show that the document reader performs better than WikiSearch API, and Document Reader model does better than some recent models for QA.",
    "weaknesses": "The final results are inferior to some other models, as presented by the authors. Also, no error analysis is provided.",
    "comments": "The proposed systems by the authors is end-to-end and interesting. However, I have some concerns below.\nDocument Retriever: Authors have shown a better retrieval performance than Wiki Search. However, it is not described as to how exactly the API is used. \nWikiSearch may not be a good baseline for querying \"questions\" (API suits structured retrieval more). Why don't the authors use some standard IR baselines for this?\nDistant Supervision: How effective and reliable was distant supervision? \nClearly, the authors had to avoid using many training examples because of this, but whatever examples the authors could use, what fraction was actually \"close to correct\"? Some statistics would be helpful to understand if some more fine-tuning of distant supervision could have helped.\nFull Wikipedia results: This was the main aim of the authors and as authors themselves said, the full system gives a performance of 26.7 (49.6 when correct doc given, 69.5 when correct paragraph is given). Clearly, that should be a motivation to work more on the retrieval aspect? For WebQuestions, the results are much inferior to YodaQA, and that raises the question -- whether Wikipedia itself is sufficient to answer all the open-domain questions? Should authors think of an integrated model to address this?  Overall, the final results shown in Tables 4 and 5 are inferior to some other models. While authors only use Wikipedia, the results are not indicative of this being the best strategy.\nOther points: The F1 value in Table 5 (78.4) is different from that in Table 4 (Both Dev and Test). \nTable 5: Why not \"No f_emb\"? \nError analysis: Some error analysis is required in various components of the system. \nAre there some specific type of questions, where the system does not perform well? Is there any way one can choose which question is a good candidate to be answered by Wikipedia, and use this method only for those questions? \nFor WebQuestions, DS degrades the performance further.",
