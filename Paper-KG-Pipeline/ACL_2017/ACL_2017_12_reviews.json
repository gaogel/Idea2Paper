    "comments": "The paper proposes a method to recognize time expressions from text. It is a simple rule-based method, which is a strong advantage as an analysis tool since time expression recognition should be a basic process in applications. \nExperiments results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art rule-based methods and machine learning based method for time expression recognition.  It is great, but my concern is generality of the method. The rules in the method were designed based on observations of corpora that are used for evaluation as well. Hence I’m afraid that the rules over-fit to these corpora. Similarly, domains of these corpora may have affected the rule design. \nThere is no statistic nor discussion to show overlaps in time expressions in the observed corpora. If it was shown that time expressions in these corpora are mostly overlap, the fact should have supported generality of the rules.  Anyway, it was better that the experiments have been conducted using a new corpus that was distinct from rule design process in order to show that the proposed method is widely effective.",
