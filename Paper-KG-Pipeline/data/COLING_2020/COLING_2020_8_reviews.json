    "comments": "The paper describes a model for morphological segmentation. \nThe model is a neural network that takes as input a representation of the word to segment and a representation of the context. \nThe model is trained and tested on mongolian data and reaches good performances (98% f measure). \nThe work is sound and well conducted but lacks a well fromulated scientific question. \nThis question could be \"is context important for morphological analysis\" and the answer will be yes, with a quanfication of the role of context. \nBut such a question is not really novel.\nIn theory, the model could be applied on other languages, it would have been interesting to see the performances on different languages offering different morphological systems.\nthe paper is generally well written, there are some typos and some formulations are not very natural  some of the typos and/or questionable formulations: p1 close related -> closely related p1 several segmentation results -> different segmentation results ? \np2 artificial linguistics ?? what is this ?? \np2 LTMS -> LSTM p3 For Self-attention -> Self-attention p5 following Vaswani -> follows Vaswani p6 we used has annotated -> we used has been annotated p7 but there is the principle a confound -> not clear what that means p9 our-word -> ??",
