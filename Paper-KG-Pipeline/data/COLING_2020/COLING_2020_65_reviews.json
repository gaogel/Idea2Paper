The aim is to enable dialog systems to keep track of dialog history in case of long dialog and stay coherent over time. \nThe paper present a clear analysis of the problem in regards of existing technics, a clear description of the model as well as the experimental setup. The evaluation of the model is particularly of a high quality: using 3 public datasets, standard evaluation based on datasets & human evaluation & ablation test to investigate the effectiveness of each module & error analysis",
