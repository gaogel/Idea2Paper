    "strengths": "- The paper design a sophisticated process to normalize three graph-based MR, achieving a significant improvement in several cross-formalism similarity measurements.\n- The paper is well written.",
    "weaknesses": "- Although a large improvement is shown in cross-formalism similarity, it isn't clear whether the normalization can benefit downstream applications. The paper reports only a small improvement in parsing F1 score under a low-resource multi-task setting. In the full resource setting, there is a \"slight to moderate decrease\" in terms of parsing accuracy. Admittedly it's related to the specific parsers being used, but there is still a possibility that the normalization process leads to some unwanted changes.",
