    "comments": "The authors propose to use LSTM models for age prediction for sentences and texts. Extensive experiments show that the best model outperforms the SOTA results (especially) at sentence level. It deserves further consideration to design better solution for text-level age prediction in the future. Overall, the paper is clearly written and well organized.\nSome typos or grammar errors: 1. section 2, \"70/17/16%\" => \"67/17/16%\", \"67/15/15%\" => \"70/15/15%\"; 2. section 2, \"all sentences of a given A text\"; 3. page 3, paragraph 1, \"The idea it gets more ...\"; 4. page 3, paragraph 2, \"The first one CONSIST in ...\"; 5. the information of reference (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005) is not complete.",
