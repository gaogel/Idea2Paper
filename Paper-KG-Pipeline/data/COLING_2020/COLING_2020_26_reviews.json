    "comments": "This paper presents a method for predicting hypernym relationships, similar to those found in WordNet, and can be considered to be in line with the tasks at SemEval and RUSSE on this task. This paper mostly seems to provide some minor extensions to a method already carried out by Cai et al. and Aly et al., and the results presented suggest that it is not significantly better than other systems submitted to RUSSE. As the papers for this workshop don't seem to be available it is hard to figure out if the comparison is fair, although the authors claim that the baselines make substantial use of external resources, explaining why they perform better. The paper is generally well-written, although a more formal description of the methodology would be helpful as there were several details (such as the similarity calculation) that were not clear to me. The evaluation is sound and goes into some detail that is nice for this task. Another issue is that the title of the paper promises evaluation over 'diachronic WordNet versions', however I could not understand what this refers to... my best guess is that they mean that they are predicting WordNet 3.0 relations based on WordNet 2.0 (??), however this may be problematic due to restructurings made between these versions. FYI to the authors: there are more recent releases of WordNet created by the Open English WordNet project, which you may want to investigate as well.",
