    "comments": "The paper presents a new approach that improves the past transition-based RST parser. The authors propose a new nuclear type and a new action to handle specific cases that the past systems have ignored.  - The authors did a good job conducting a series of experiments along the ablation studies that help us understand how each component contributes to the improvement.\n- The reviewer is quite confused with the description for the \"Separate\" system.\n- The paper will benefit from a diagram similar to the one presented in Dozat's paper. Bi-Affine model is not a well-known model. The authors should include a diagram also.\n- It takes some guesswork to understand how EDU representation is derived from the sentence representation. We simply average across all of the words in the EDU? Should there be a better way to derive that? Could we instead run BiLSTM over the EDU instead and then pass it through the Bi-Affine model?  - What's the differences between row1 and row2 in Table2? Please explain more.\n- The claim of this paper is that the new nuclear type and new action (and Bi-Affine features too?) contributes to the improvement. Table2 should label more clearly which feature is involved here.  - The idea of R^ and N^ is somewhat similar to the idea of markovization in phrase structure parsing, which is a classic technique in CYK parsing with PCFG. It would be nice to relate to the idea or argue why it is different.",
