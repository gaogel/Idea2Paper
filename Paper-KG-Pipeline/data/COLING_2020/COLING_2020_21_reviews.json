The paper should state more clearly at the outset that the research was performed on English data. I would even argue for \"100,000 Podcasts: A Large-Scale Spoken English Document Corpus\" See https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/ Table 3 is opaque to me and would profit from column headers or a more elaborate caption.",
