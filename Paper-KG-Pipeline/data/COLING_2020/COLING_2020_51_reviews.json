    "strengths": "1. Even though the paper contains several typos and unclearness, it is well-written and easy to follow.\n\t2. The proposed mechanisms make sense. The EGA provides a context-aware entity encoder and the CAT is a form of negative sampling for mitigating difficult cases. Both contributes to the final model for this task.\n\t3. The study of How to Gate and When to Gate is interesting and worth deeper analysis.",
    "weaknesses": "1. The main weakness is that the result on the test set is NOT reported. I can understand that since the FewRel test set is not publicly available and they asks task participants to submit their models to get the test result, it is hard to control the turnaround time. However, the competitive result on the validation set cannot convince everyone that their model",
