    "strengths": "- This is an interesting evaluation with various attempts to explain the observed results. Conclusions/recommendations are provided as well. Data quality tends to be a problem that needs to be addressed, either because collected data is too simple/easy/naively collected or because it contains errors.\n- The article is well-written.",
    "weaknesses": "- Experiments used mostly code released by the authors of the original papers. There are some guesses/default values used here. It would be good include a note on how the performance reported here for single target datasets compares to the numbers presented by the system developers -- especially since this is done on SimpleQuestions, which is not greatly altered by the filtering of multiple-triple questions outside of FB2M.",
