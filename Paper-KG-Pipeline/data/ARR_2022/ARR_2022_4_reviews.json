    "paper_summary": "This paper studies the research problem of Adversarial Attack on text data. Specifically, it focused on fooling stock prediction models over the Tweet data. It proposes a Hierarchical perturbation to generate attack and formulates the attack generation problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. Experiments are conducted on real world datasets and the results over 3 prediction models are comprehensive. ",
    "strengths": "S1. The research problem is important and useful in real world applications.\nS2. The experiment design is good.\nS3. The results are comprehensive. ",
    "weaknesses": "Technical contribution is not so significant. ",
    "comments": "I am aware that this paper is a re-submission of a paper that I have reviewed before. This time the presentation improves a lot and more details are added as attachment. So I insist on my previous positive rating. ",
    "overall_score": "3.5 ",
    "confidence": "3 =  Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math or experimental design."
