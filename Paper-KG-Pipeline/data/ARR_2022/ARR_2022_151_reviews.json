    "paper_summary": "This paper introduces a momentum method in the DR training process to improve the generalization ability of zero-shot dense retrieval via a combination of a document classifier and an adversarially trained encoder. ",
    "strengths": "• a novel  momentum-based adversarial training method for the domain invariant representation. \n    • 10 plus  boost of performance over baselines on public benchmark datasets. ",
    "weaknesses": "It is understandable the authors relate their work to dense retrieval  and adversarial training but it is dubious why not similar applications of momentum are not discussed given that  the authors themselves did not  equal  this proposed method to the latter. ",
    "comments": "No obvious errors of writing is noticed. ",
    "overall_score": "4 = Strong: This paper is of significant interest (for broad or narrow sub-communities), and warrants acceptance in a top-tier *ACL venue if space allows.",
    "confidence": "3 =  Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math or experimental design."
