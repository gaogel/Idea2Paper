Where is NLP research presented? What are the environmental costs? What are the diversity benefits? Finally, they discussed about the carbon cost and diversity gain associated with conferences in the ACL Anthology. ",
    "strengths": "The paper is well-organized and it's easy to follow. They described the process in detail and analyzed the results using various charts. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. I'm concerned about is the relevance of the paper to the theme of ACL.\n2. I think it is a technical paper, not a research paper. For example, it did not give the model details and only present the technological process.\n3. This paper did not compare with the previous work, it is hard to identify its novelty. ",
    "comments": "NONE ",
    "overall_score": "3 = Good: This paper is of interest to the *ACL audience and could be published, but might not be appropriate for a top-tier publication venue. It would likely be a strong paper in a suitable workshop.",
    "confidence": "3 =  Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math or experimental design."
