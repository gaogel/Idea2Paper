Perhaps such a resource would be better presented in a specialised workshop such as BEA or a specialised conference on language resources like LREC instead of a general NLP conference like ACL.\nYou mentioned in the last paragraph that you would like to augment the corpus with more annotation. Are you also willing to include more essays?\nComments/Minor: - As you have essays by native and non-native speakers, one further potential application of this corpus is native language identification (NLI).\n- p. 7: \"where the unigram feature was used as the baseline\" - \"word unigram\". \nBe more specific.\n- p. 7: \"and the SVM classifier was used as the classifier.\" - redundant.",
