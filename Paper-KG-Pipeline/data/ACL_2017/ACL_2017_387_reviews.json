    "strengths": "This paper tackles an interesting problem and provides a (to my knowledge) novel and reasonable way of learning and combining cognitive features with textual features for sentiment analysis and irony detection. The paper is  clearly written and organized, and the authors provided a lot of useful detail and informative example and plots. Most of the results are convincing, and the authors did a good job comparing their approach and results with previous work.",
    "weaknesses": "1. Just from the reading abstract, I expected that the authors' approach would significantly outperform previous methods, and that using both the eye-gaze and textual features consistently yields the best results. Upon reading the actual results section, however, it seems like the findings were more mixed. I think it would be helpful to update the abstract and introduction to reflect this. \n2. When evaluating the model on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis, were the sarcastic utterances included? Did the model do better on classifying the non-sarcastic utterances than the sarcastic ones? \n3. I understand why the eye-movement data would be useful for sarcasm detection, but it wasn't as obvious to me why it would be helpful for (non-sarcastic) sentiment classification beyond the textual features.",
    "comments": "This paper contains a lot of interesting content, and the approach seems solid and novel to me. The results were a little weaker than I had anticipated from the abstract, but I believe would still be interesting to the larger community and merits publication.",

    "strengths": "(1) A deep CNN framework is proposed to extract and combine cognitive features with textual features for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection.  (2) The ideas is interesting and novelty.",
    "weaknesses": "(1) Replicability would be an important concern. Researchers cannot replicate the system/method for improvement due to lack of data for feature extraction.",
    "comments": "Overall, this paper is well written and organized. The experiments are conducted carefully for comparison with previous work and the analysis is reasonable. I offer some comments as follows.\n(1)           Does this model be suitable on sarcastic/non-sarcastic utterances? \nThe authors should provide more details for further analysis.  (2)           Why the eye-movement data would be useful for sarcastic/non-sarcastic sentiment classification beyond the textual features? The authors should provide more explanations.",
