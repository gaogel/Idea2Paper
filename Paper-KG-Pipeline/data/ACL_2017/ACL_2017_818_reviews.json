    "strengths": "The topic of the paper is very creative and the purpose of the research really worthwhile: the paper aims at extracting common knowledge from text, overcoming the well-known problem of reporting bias (the fact that people will not state the obvious, such as the fact that a person is usually bigger than a ball), by doing joint inference on information that is possible to extract from text.",
    "weaknesses": "1) Many aspects of the approach need to be clarified (see detailed comments below). What worries me the most is that I did not understand how the approach makes knowledge about objects interact with knowledge about verbs such that it allows us to overcome reporting bias. The paper gets very quickly into highly technical details, without clearly explaining the overall approach and why it is a good idea.\n2) The experiments and the discussion need to be finished. In particular, there is no discussion of the results of one of the two tasks tackled (lower half of Table 2), and there is one obvious experiment missing: Variant B of the authors' model gives much better results on the first task than Variant A, but for the second task only Variant A is tested -- and indeed it doesn't improve over the baseline.",
    "comments": "The paper needs quite a bit of work before it is ready for publication.  - Detailed comments: 026 five dimensions, not six Figure 1, caption: \"implies physical relations\": how do you know which physical relations it implies?\nFigure 1 and 113-114: what you are trying to do, it looks to me, is essentially to extract lexical entailments (as defined in formal semantics; see e.g. Dowty 1991) for verbs. Could you please explicit link to that literature?\nDowty, David. \" Thematic proto-roles and argument selection.\" Language (1991): 547-619.\n135 around here you should explain the key insight of your approach: why and how does doing joint inference over these two pieces of information help overcome reporting bias?\n141 \"values\" ==> \"value\"?\n143 please also consider work on multimodal distributional semantics, here and/or in the related work section. The following two papers are particularly related to your goals: Bruni, Elia, et al. \"Distributional semantics in technicolor.\" Proceedings of the 50th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Long Papers-Volume 1. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2012.\nSilberer, Carina, Vittorio Ferrari, and Mirella Lapata. \" Models of Semantic Representation with Visual Attributes.\" ACL (1). 2013.\n146 please clarify that your contribution is the specific task and approach -- commonsense knowledge extraction from language is long-standing task.\n152 it is not clear what \"grounded\" means at this point Section 2.1: why these dimensions, and how did you choose them?\n177 explain terms \"pre-condition\" and \"post-condition\", and how they are relevant here 197-198 an example of the full distribution for an item (obtained by the model, or crowd-sourced, or \"ideal\") would help.\nFigure 2. I don't really see the \"x is slower than y\" part: it seems to me like this is related to the distinction, in formal semantics, between stage-level vs. individual-level predicates: when a person throws a ball, the ball is faster than the person (stage-level) but it's not true in general that balls are faster than people (individual-level). \nI guess this is related to the pre-condition vs. post-condition issue. Please spell out the type of information that you want to extract.\n248 \"Above definition\": determiner missing Section 3 \"Action verbs\": Which 50 classes do you pick, and you do you choose them? Are the verbs that you pick all explicitly tagged as action verbs by Levin?  306ff What are \"action frames\"? How do you pick them?\n326 How do you know whether the frame is under- or over-generating?\nTable 1: are the partitions made by frame, by verb, or how? That is, do you reuse verbs or frames across partitions? Also, proportions are given for 2 cases (2/3 and 3/3 agreement), whereas counts are only given for one case; which?\n336 \"with... PMI\": something missing (threshold?)\n371 did you do this partitions randomly?\n376 \"rate *the* general relationship\" 378 \"knowledge dimension we choose\": ? ( how do you choose which dimensions you will annotate for each frame?)\nSection 4 What is a factor graph? Please give enough background on factor graphs for a CL audience to be able to follow your approach. What are substrates, and what is the role of factors? How is the factor graph different from a standard graph? \nMore generally, at the beginning of section 4 you should give a higher level description of how your model works and why it is a good idea.\n420 \"both classes of knowledge\": antecedent missing.\n421 \"object first type\" 445 so far you have been only talking about object pairs and verbs, and suddenly selectional preference factors pop in. They seem to be a crucial part of your model -- introduce earlier? In any case, I didn't understand their role.\n461 \"also\"?\n471 where do you get verb-level similarities from?\nFigure 3: I find the figure totally unintelligible. Maybe if the text was clearer it would be interpretable, but maybe you can think whether you can find a way to convey your model a bit more intuitively. Also, make sure that it is readable in black-and-white, as per ACL submission instructions.\n598 define term \"message\" and its role in the factor graph.\n621 why do you need a \"soft 1\" instead of a hard 1?\n647ff you need to provide more details about the EMB-MAXENT classifier (how did you train it, what was the input data, how was it encoded), and also explain why it is an appropriate baseline.\n654 \"more skimp seed knowledge\": ?\n659 here and in 681, problem with table reference (should be Table 2).  664ff I like the thought but I'm not sure the example is the right one: in what sense is the entity larger than the revolution? Also, \"larger\" is not the same as \"stronger\".\n681 as mentioned above, you should discuss the results for the task of inferring knowledge on objects, and also include results for model (B) (incidentally, it would be better if you used the same terminology for the model in Tables 1 and 2) 778 \"latent in verbs\": why don't you mention objects here?\n781 \"both tasks\": antecedent missing The references should be checked for format, e.g. Grice, Sorower et al for capitalization, the verbnet reference for bibliographic details.",

What are some interesting action verbs and corresponding attributes relations?  The paper also lacks analysis/discussion  on what kind of mistakes their model makes.\n- The number of object pairs (3656) in the dataset is very small.  How many distinct object categories are there?  How scalable is this approach to larger number of object pairs?\n- It's a bit unclear how the frame similarity factors and attributes similarity factors are selected.",

    "strengths": "The paper tries to solve an interesting and challenging problem. The problem is hard due to reporting bias, and the key insight/approach in the paper is inspiring.\nThe model is innovative and clearly described. And the idea of handling text sparsity with semantic similarity factors is also appropriate.  The empirical evidence well supports the effectiveness of the model (compared to other baselines).  The paper is well-written, with informative visualization, except for some minor errors like *six dimensions* in abstract but *five* everywhere else.",
    "weaknesses": "The benefits and drawbacks of model components are still somehow under-discussed, and hard to tell with the limited quantitative results in the paper.  For example, is there any inherent discrepancy between *cross-verb frame similarity*, *within-verb frame similarity* and *action-object compatibility*? \nFrames of *A throw B* and *C thrown by D* share a verb primitive *throw*, so should it infer C>D (by *within-verb*) if A>B is given? \nOn the other side, frames of *C thrown by D* and *E kicked by F* share the frame *XXX by*, so if F>E is known, is D>C inferred? How does the current model deal with such discrepancy?\nThe paper might be better if it has more qualitative analysis. And more evidence also needs to be provided to gauge how difficult the task/dataset is.\nFor example, are the incorrectly-classified actions/objects also ambiguous for human? On what types of actions/objects does the model tend to make mistakes? \nIs the verb with more frame types usually harder than others for the model?\nMore interestingly, how are the mistakes made? Are they incorrectly enforced by any proposed *semantic similarity*?\nI think more analysis on the model components and qualitative results may inspire more general framework for this task.",
    "comments": "/* After author response */ After reading the response, I tend to keep my current rating and accept this paper. The response well addresses my concerns. And I tend to believe that necessary background and experimental analysis can be added given some re-organization of the paper and one extra page, as it is not hard.  /* Before author response */ I think this paper is in general solid and interesting. \nI tend to accept it, but it would be better if the questions above can be answered.",
