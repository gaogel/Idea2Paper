    "strengths": "1) This paper proposed a semi-automated framework (human generation -> auto expansion -> human post-editing) to construct a compositional semantic similarity evaluation data set.\n2) The proposed framework is used to create a Polish compositional semantic similarity evaluation data set which is useful for future work in developing Polish compositional semantic models.",
    "weaknesses": "1) The proposed framework has only been tested on one language. It is not clear whether the framework is portable to other languages. For example, the proposed framework relies on a dependency parser which may not be available in some languages or in poor performance in some other languages.\n2) The number of sentence pairs edited by leader judges is not reported so the correctness and efficiency of the automatic expansion framework can not be evaluated. The fact that more than 3% (369 out of 10k) of the post-edited pairs need further post-editing is worrying.  3) There are quite a number of grammatical mistakes. Here are some examples but not the complete and exhaustive list: line 210, 212, 213: \"on a displayed image/picture\" -> \"in a displayed image/picture\" line 428: \"Similarly as in\" -> \"Similar to\" A proofread pass on the paper is needed.",
