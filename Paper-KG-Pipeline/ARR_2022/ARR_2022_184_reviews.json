    "paper_summary": "In this work, the authors introduced a multi-lingual benchmark for the development and testing of bias-mitigation models or algorithms for legal text, namely FairLex. They have dealt with four datasets covering four jurisdictions, five languages, and various sensitive attributes.  They have provided competitive baselines implemented with state-of-the-art transformer-based models. As per the experimental results, we cannot identify a single algorithm that performs better across datasets. ",
    "strengths": "This work deals with an interesting problem of fairness in legal text processing. The proposed benchmark would be very useful in this direction of research.  Choosing the datasets covering four different jurisdictions and five different languages could motivate to build generalized models as well. Overall, the paper is nicely written, easy to follow. ",
    "weaknesses": "Nothing as such!! ",
    "comments": "Nothing as such!! ",
    "overall_score": "4 = Strong: This paper is of significant interest (for broad or narrow sub-communities), and warrants acceptance in a top-tier *ACL venue if space allows.",
    "confidence": "2 =  Willing to defend my evaluation, but it is fairly likely that I missed some details, didn't understand some central points, or can't be sure about the novelty of the work."
