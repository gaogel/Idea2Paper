    "weaknesses": "Results are varying so much on two different datasets ",
    "comments": "Did you use an attention mechanism? If yes, what are the significant changes you observed between the two approaches? If not, could you please check a performance comparison with any attention mechanism? \n Why are the results varying so much on two different datasets? Is your model biased on a particular data? Did you check the disparity and fairness of data? ",
