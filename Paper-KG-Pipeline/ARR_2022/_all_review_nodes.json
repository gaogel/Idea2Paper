    "paper_summary": "This papers presents a new dataset for evaluating model performance on figurative language. The dataset is Wino-grad style: it contains figurative phrases with divergent meanings, allowing assessment of whether models can correctly identify the appropriate interpretation of figurative phrases. This dataset is composed via crowdsourcing, with extensive expert validation. An analysis of the dataset is presented, including some linguistic analysis of what types of figuration and syntactic structures are present, as well as analysis of what kinds of metaphors. They then evaluate two types of models on the proposed task of identifying the correct meaning. Additional prompting-based improvements are proposed, as well as some analysis of how the models can work for generating interpretations. Comprehensive error analysis is performed, with a particular eye for where model performance and human performance differ, offering some interesting insights into the difficulty of processing metaphoric language. ",
    "strengths": "The paper is clear and well-written, and presents a strong background knowledge of the linguistic aspects of metaphor. It is framed particularly well wrt. the background literature, and I personally found the authors attention to the linguistic aspects of the proposed dataset to be encouraging. The proposed dataset seems very well thought out, and the extensive expert checks indicate that the resulting dataset is of high quality. This kind of resource is currently valuable not just for the inspection of LMs as proposed, but also for paraphrasing and generation tasks, and I see this dataset being a very valuable resource. The analysis performed is good, and the difference between the auto-regressive and masked language models is an interesting finding. ",
    "weaknesses": "There is of course a fair amount of creativity in the pairs, which may yield some strange inferences. There's something about these paired sentences with the sarcastic reading (\"bright as coal\", \"easy as kindergarten for a newborn\") that seem particuarly forced: I wouldn't expect these sentences to be very common in everyday language, and then perhaps LM performance is expected, as they wouldn't have seen these things before. I feel they're a strange kind of sentence with a somewhat difficult semantics even for humans. For the pilot pair, I'm not sure I would get the intended meanings for the difference between \"ballet dancer\" and \"modern dancer\" - I feel the \"dancer\" alone could yield either reading. So there may be quirks in the dataset that make it tricky to interpret exactly what's going on with model performance.\nI'm curious about the strong performance of the RoBERTa model - could it be that this kind of classification task isn't particularly difficult, if we give the model enough training and data? I think the paper shows clear difficulties in the generation and inference aspects, but perhaps classification is getting better. ",
    "comments": "It should be noted that there are also lots of recent work on novel, challenging NLI sets, which the authors seem aware of. There are some recent and contemporary works that also deal with figurative language (Chakrabarty 2021, \"Figurative Language in RTE\", Poliak 2018, https://aclanthology.org/D18-1007/) the authors should be aware of: in my mind, this work provides a novel, high-quality dataset, they could benefit from clarifying how their work is distinct from these.\nA possible question: this work seems focused on starting with metaphors and getting literal interpretations. I think there are also significant applications the other way, particularly in metaphor generation, where the literal interpretations can be used as input and the metaphors as output. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper introduced Fig-QA, a Winograd-style nonliteral language understanding task consisting of correctly interpreting paired figurative phrases with divergent meanings.  The authors evaluated the performance of several language models with Fig-QA and found that the models achieve performance significantly over chance, but  largely fall beyond human performance. ",
    "strengths": "The authors opened a new perspective in the milieu of ACL with this figurative language.  They first organized its typology and presented quantitative results.  Then the authors crowdsourced 10256 metaphors and call it Fig-QA, a new benchmark task.  It can be used to evaluate the nonliteral reasoning abilities of language models, from multiple viewpoint of zero-shot, fine-tuned and prompting methods.  The overall proposal introduced a novel way to evaluate the language models, and showed how they indeed are far from human capability.\nThe discussion of the limitation of the present language models is rich and this work provides an important understanding about SOTA language models in the way different from other language model evaluation papers. ",
    "weaknesses": "I guess that there are theories about figurative languages. How can section 3.2 be grounded among such theory? If he authors could ground their results in relation to such theories, I think this paper will have even larger impact. ",
    "comments": "Just a conjecture, but I am a non-native and I am certain that I am worse than GPT in these tasks. \nI guess that a non-native human cannot do well in these tasks, in general. \n If you crowdsource the performance on Fig-QA among non-natives, it might reveal what could be  necessary to train LMs.\n-It would be good if Fig-QA is  built for  other languages as well.\n-Although I did not find any datasets nor software attached, I highly recommend Fig-QA to be publicised.

    "paper_summary": "This paper tests the ability of large pretrained language models to assign correct meanings to creative metaphors in English, and also to generate plausible interpretations of such metaphors. Pretrained models are capable of doing this, but performance falls far short of human-level in both zero-shot and pre-trained settings. Models employ a variety of interpretive heuristics such as absolute probability of the answer. ",
    "strengths": "Tasks for which pre-trained LMs do a significantly worse job than humans even with fine-tuning are relatively hard to find. This task is hard even for fine-tuned GPT-3, which makes it a good potential benchmark for future research into figurative language. There is an extensive set of experiments and a relatively large novel dataset. Overall, I think this paper is quite strong. ",
    "weaknesses": "The paper \"A howling success or a working sea? Testing what BERT knows about metaphors\" by Pedinotti et al, Blackbox NLP 21, should be cited here if possible. ",
    "comments": "I suspect the forced-choice setting makes a significant difference to human interpreters, as suggested in ft. 2 \"The opposing meanings help to avoid ambiguity in the correct answer, make the task intuitive for human annotators, and help prevent annotation artifacts that have plagued other NLI datasets.\" Seeing both possible answers makes the pragmatic scale on which the metaphor is being interpreted very explicit (for metaphor interpretation as structural mapping of conceptual domains, see eg Gentner and Bowdle 2008). For example, \"He hustles like he's a billionaire's son\" (Table 1) might be interpreted as a description of how he gets things done (by using his contacts and social privilege) or of how hard he works (not hard because he doesn't need to). The scale \"not at all - hardcore\" selects the meaning. Similarly, \"She was as embarrassed as a kid who got an A\" might mean she is ashamed of being called a nerd, or proud of her academic success. Natural examples of creative metaphors with unexpected scalar mappings are not hard to find (for instance, the American F4 Phantom jet was nicknamed the \"Flying Brick\"; while as a conventional metaphor, \"flies like a brick\" means \"cannot fly at all\", the intended meaning is that the Phantom was unaerodynamic but had a very powerful engine).\nWhile the paper notes that humans do not have a problem processing metaphors (sec 7.3), I believe these results are for metaphors in context, and often for conventional ones, not creative ones. I am not sure of whether similar results apply to creative metaphors, especially out of context. ",

    "paper_summary": "The paper extrinsically studies different methods to transfer visual knowledge to language models (LMs) for commonsense reasoning tasks assumed to require physical/visual knowledge. \nThe methods differ in  (i) the domain of the data for pre-training (e.g., pre-training LMs on text of the visual domain (MSCOCO captions), and training visual-linguistic models using MSCOCO's images-caption pairs), as well as in  (ii) the pre-training objectives (voken classification, MLM, cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL), cross-modal knowledge distillation).  Models: The authors experimentally compare text-only BERT-base and a range of existing cross-modal models, pretrained with the different objectives, as far as applicable.   Experiments are conducted on 5 downstream tasks (PIQA, Visual Paraphrasing, OBQA, Metaphora on RiddleSense). In both, the low-resource and fully supervised setting, using contrastive learning (CL) seems to be the only beneficial cross-modal pre-training method (ii) applied for the visual-linguistic models (and only with additional sampling strategies in the case of pre-training on *image*-caption pairs)---these models slightly improve over the cross-modal baseline models (MLM) as well as the text-based LM (BERT).  The authors further demonstrate that for general language understanding (GLUE benchmark), the visual-linguistic models overall are less effective than text-only BERT. ",

That visual information, from captions or images, together with contrastive learning, is slightly beneficial for downstream tasks underlying visual commonsense? I am  missing insights into       - why the other pretraining strategies fail           - why there is, overall, basically no difference in performance between pre-training on captions or on images (shouldn't the latter even be more informative than captions?) \n         - why pre-training on visual-linguistic data is harmful for general NLU instead of just not beneficial. \n     - It is positive that such a range of different visual-linguistic models have been examined. However, from their descriptions in Section 3 I am not sure I can assess whether these models are fairly comparable.  - Text-based comparison baseline: BERT-base is a weak model compared to BERT-large or RoBERTa -- would the conclusion that visual information can be integrated and leads to better commonsense reasoning behaviour hold when these stronger purely text-based LMs were used?

The visual knowledge can be categorized into textual knowledge from captions and knowledge from image-caption pairs. Authors first study which types of knowledge can benefit which tasks. Besides, the authors also explore which knowledge transfer methods are beneficial for the downstream tasks. Experimental results show that visual knowledge helps tasks related to physical commonsense, especially in few-shot settings. Also, models can be further improved with the help of knowledge distillation and contrastive learning methods. ",
    "strengths": "1. Meaningful analysis: It is a natural idea to study how vision modality can help textual tasks. And intermediate pre-training on visual knowledge is a great choice to evaluate the role of visual knowledge in the process. \n2.

I'm also a bit confusing about why the authors choose MSCOCO as the caption dataset instead of the larger Conceptual Captions. \n2. Lack of knowledge probing tasks: Since the paper mainly studies how to evaluate the \"knowledge\" transfer, it is natural to consider adopting knowledge probing task such as LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019) to evaluate whether models already study the knowledge.

    "paper_summary": "My understanding of this paper is that they adapt a framework of “metamorphic relations” for use in probing an LM. This is a relation between inputs, follow up inputs based on the internal structure of those inputs, and outputs. The distinction between this and previous work is that they consider relations between inputs, rather than looking at single inputs.  The first experiment they run is applying a particular transformation, in the form of extra words, to a pair of texts. They then run a sentiment classifier and see whether that classifier maintains are ranking between the pair of sequences after their transformation. If it maintains a ranking, this indicates that the model is systematic. The next experiment also involves transformations in NLI inputs, which lead to specific changes in inference labels. Finally, they test if transitive relations of hypernymy and synonymity, when applied to pairs (x1,x2) and (x2,x3), also apply to (x1,x3). ",
    "strengths": "Overall I really like these complex rule based methods. I think that this is more principled and clearly considered than probing methods which use learned peripheral models. ",
    "weaknesses": "I’m skeptical that systematicity requires that the same transformation always makes the same adjustment geometrically on the output. Consider the following examples:  “I just bought this new software.” \n“I just bought this new mascara.”\nNow we append the same transformation to the text: “It doesn’t run!” We shouldn’t expect that this transformation is going to have the same effect on both reviews, and yet you would consider this to not be a systematic combination. A transformation that has different effects based on context is not necessarily a systematicity violation.\n“we can conclude that pairwise-systematicity testing reveals a different issue in the model f than classic non-metamorphic testing.” Where is the classic testing that you would contrast this with to check whether this issue shows up?\nIn general, it seems like one advantage of this method *should* be avoiding the expense of gold standard labels that would be used for another kind of probe, but if instead you need to have a bunch of information about hypernyms and hyponyms, that doesn’t seem like a significant gain. ",
    "comments": "This paper needs more examples of the kind of relation they are looking at, earlier in the paper as well as throughout the paper. Without examples, it’s hard to evaluate whether the transforming the source inputs with T is more expensive than using ground truth data.  Should the section on the geometry of hypernyms possibly have a citation to http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/allen19a/allen19a.pdf ? I’m not necessarily pushing it but maybe you should check.\nIf you don’t have any further geometric analysis, it’s not clear to me that section 4.2 adds any information, as it seems to just be a set of definitions that are not later used.\nI’m not clear on why Yanaka et al. wouldn’t be considered a metamorphic test as well? ( line 520).\nI found several points where I was extremely confused. I don’t understand how you are avoiding having any kind of ground truth labels for things like hypernymy? If you don’t have hypernym information for a particular word set, how will you be able to know whether they are maintaining the output property at all? ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes using metamorphic testing to verify the behavior of NLP models. One appeal of this approach is that it can be used in some cases without collecting any training data, verifying that the outputs obey some desired relation between inputs, rather than being “correct” in the sense that they match the ground truth. The authors outline a general metamorphic testing framework (with a useful graphical model formalism to describe different variants of it), and show how most past work falls narrowly into the category of robustness tests. A robustness test is where a transformation is made to the input, and then the test verifies that some property (e.g., label invariance) holds between the original and modified inputs. In contrast, they propose three different extensions of this approach beyond robustness for systematicity, compositionality, and transitivity. Systematicity testing essentially generalizes robustness testing to take a model’s performance on related instances as a ground truth. Compositionality testing as formulated here is testing some level of faithfulness: does the representation of some semantic property in the model encode whether or not the model outputs reflect that property? Finally, transitivity testing tests whether relations between inputs that should be transitive obey transitivity. Overall, I find the general framework and specific results to be valuable contributions. ",
    "strengths": "1. The paper is well written and organized. The framework seems like a useful high-level contribution for testing NLP models, and the graphical model formalism seems like a useful formalism for visualizing and comparing different testing approaches. \n2. The systematicity testing is an interesting novel evaluation paradigm. I did not expect out-of-the-box NLP models to perform so well on this (+90%). \n3. The compositionality test also seems useful, and it is probably easier to interpret the numbers coming out of it in absolute terms compared to probing, since we should expect a strong model to achieve 100% performance. \n4. It is interesting that the transitivity test – which formalizes whether the model predictions satisfy transitivity when they should (independent of whether they are correct) suggests that models are highly non-transitive. This result is a valuable contribution, especially given that more primitive fully supervised transitivity tests have reached the opposite conclusion. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The compositionality and transitivity tests require labeled data to train the probes, which defeats some of the utility of the method. \n2. Compositionality typically means something like “the meaning of a full expression can be computed recursively as a function of its parts, where the structure of the recursion is modulated by the syntactic structure.” I don’t think that’s exactly what your “compositionality” test is formalizing, though it is somewhat related. I would suggest changing the name to something more precise; perhaps “faithfulness”, since what you’re really testing is the correspondence between the relations the model encodes and the relations that exist in the output? Or maybe I’m missing something, and you can elaborate on how this test reflects a more general definition of compositionality. \n3. There is an inconsistency in the presentation of the systematicity test. In Equation 4, the test checks whether Psrc => Pflw. Later on, at line 340: this is condition is written as being bidirectional: Psrc ⇔ Pflw. Which one of these is right? \n4. It's not obvious how humans would do under this kind of linguistic evaluation. It would be interesting to do human evaluations of this method. In other words, use human annotators in the role of the model, and see how well they do compared to neural models as a baseline. ",
    "comments": "- What is the training data for your probes in the compositionality and transitivity experiments?\n- For the transitivity experiments, does 50% constitute a random baseline? If so, do you have any potential explanation why models are so substantially undershooting random guessing?\n- The notation of x1 and x2 vs. x = (xa, xb) in the compositionality section is a bit confusing, especially when x1 and x2 are already themselves pairs. I would suggest changing this. Maybe you could have x and x’, or rewrite xa as x_{11} and xb as x_{12}. It was unclear whether x_1 was a pair or single sentence on my first read.\n- Nit: In Def 2.2, is v a constant across all R, or can we pick a different v for each R? This is only a technical concern when the number of examples is countably infinite.\n- Line 405: This last sentence seems a bit circular. You’ve defined systematicity such that the geometric property is satisfied if and only if f is systematic. If this is all you mean, I think the sentence could be clarified, but currently, it seems like it may be making a stronger claim than this.  - Line 530: Use \\citep not \\citet ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes a latent-variable model based on a variational probabilistic modeling framework for conditional compute in multi-domain and multilingual machine translation. They introduce latent variables which are learned during model training. These latent variables decide which sub-network of the model is selected for each task / language pair. \nThe results on multi-domain machine translation show promise compared to vanilla Transformer and Adapter baselines. But most of the improvements can be captured by a heuristic multi-task group dropout baseline, and there is a small improvement (0.5 bleu) over this baseline with the variational approach proposed. \nThe paper includes some interesting analysis of the models as well. On the other hand, some one important ablations on whether group dropout helps vs a baseline with group size=1 is missing and the improvements on multilingual translation are not significant enough. Overall, this leaves me unsure whether the added complexity of this approach is worth it over the simpler baselines (vanilla Transformer or heuristic multi-task group dropout). ",
    "strengths": "1. This work proposes a technique to learn which subnetworks to use for which task / language pair based on learning from the data. \n2. The proposed probabilistic framework is mathematically sound and explained clearly and completely. \n3. There are experiments compared with decent baselines and multiple benchmarks and there has been a good attempt to evaluate the new technique well. \n4. The analysis showing that accuracy of Adapter baselines declines on a domain when that domain is divided into two pseudo-domains, where as the accuracy on this proposed framework remains the same motivates the reason of using the proposed technique very well 5. A nice advantage of this approach is that it doesn’t need additional parameters to the added to the baseline Transformer model. There are some additional hyper-parameters to tune correctly per setup though. \n6. There is also analysis showing whether the learned subnetworks for related domains/languages overlap significantly. \n7. [ Updated] A nice baseline - heuristic multi-task group dropout has been added in the revised version of the paper that helps disentangle the impact of the variational approach. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. While the authors mention leaving this to future work, the study of how many groups to divide each layer into is missing and how sensitive is model performance to the choice of number of groups is missing → how does the proposed group dropout compare to just a regular dropout with group size = 1; I think this is important because the paper proposes “Latent Group Dropout” and whether group dropout is needed or not is a key question that is not experimentally verified. \n2. “ heuristic multi-task group dropout” (HMGD) captures most of the improvements between Transformer vs proposed LaMGD with a 0.5 BLEU difference between HMGD and LaMGD - It is worth making a case that the simpler approach HMGD is also a win 3. It is unclear if there was an attempt to tune the sizes and dropout for the adapter modules in the adapters baseline 4. Table 5 - very few pairs (7 out of 32) show significant gains over the Transformer baseline - it is actually unclear how much language specific model capacity helps on this TED benchmark at all.

Requiring partitioning nodes into groups and a fixed number of nodes to be activated at each layer makes their method less flexible. \n3. More baselines should be included (e.g. Li et al., (2020), Gong et al., (2021a, b) as mentioned in the paper).\nAfter reading the response: The added sensitivity analysis - Thanks for adding the sensitivity analysis on $k$! However, more analyses are still required as in my previous comment (e.g. the effect of $n_d$, the use of the annealing strategy for $\\tau$, analysis of the translation outputs, ...).\nThe flexibility of their approach - The method requires a fixed number of nodes to be activated at each layer for all the tasks. This is inflexible because intuitively, harder tasks require more nodes to process while simpler tasks may only need a few nodes. However, their method cannot take this into account, and thus the method is not very flexible.\nThe added baseline - It'd be better to compare with published baselines (e.g. [1, 2]). The baselines share similar claims as the author(s) mentioned in the rebuttal. I agree that this paper doesn't need to obtain state-of-the-art performance, however, the comparisons are necessary so that other researchers can know which methods to use in practice. Therefore, comparisons are required even if the results are not favorable to their method.\n[1] Lin et al., Learning Language-Specific Sub-network for Multilingual Machine Translation, ACL 2021. \n[2] Li et al., Deep transformers with latent depth, NeurIPS 2020.

Two major claims are: 1. improve SOTA performance when generalizing to unseen environments (Room-across-room dataset) 2. learned representations can be successfully transferred to other datasets. ",
    "strengths": "1. The work takes the VLN task into a very interesting and practical dimension of understanding multilingual instructions; this is especially intriguing for Indic languages (such as Hindi and Telugu) which colloquially often employ code-switching between different Indic languages or between Indic languages and English (for example the word English word \"sink\" is used in the Hindi instruction in Figure 1, and a transliteration of \"wash basin\" has been used in Telugu). An agent that understands such phenomena could be quite useful in such situations. \n2. The work is well motivated -- different languages may contain different forms of instructions and learning jointly could lead to more robust representations. \n3. Overfitting is a significant challenge in reinforcement learning methods in navigation.  The proposed solution addresses that issue by means of contrastive learning between semantically aligned paths. \n4. Experimental settings seem to be sound, and benchmarking is exhaustive. \n5. Gains w.r.t. baselines are non-trivial on multiple evaluation metrics. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. My biggest concern is that the analysis doesn't provide insights on WHICH language benefits WHICH other language in a multilingual setup. The only comparison provided is mono-vs-tri-lingual, but we should also compare vs bi-lingual (For example -- comparing En+Hi, En+Te, Hi+Te vs En+Hi+Te).  This analysis may point to interesting observations on which language combination is more effective. I understand that the authors want to show us that multi-lingual representations improve performance, but understanding the relationship between different languages in this context of VLN is an equally important aspect -- the experimental setting of this paper is perfectly poised to provide this analysis, but the results are tucked away in the Appendix -- this should be moved to the main paper. \n2. [ presentation of results] Table 2 should also include the best result from Shen et al. 2021 (one of the baselines), so that we can compare the finegrained results on each language and metric. \n3. There seems to be some discrepancy between the scores for RxR in Table 1 and the scores reported by Shen et al for RxR (see Table 4 in Shen et al.) -- could you elaborate why? \n4. Sec 6.3 results are provided inline, but not as a figure/table.  It is difficult to understand the improvements easily. I would strongly recommend making this a table, and also providing SOTA methods for R2R and CVDN in that table (not just the baselines). This will tell us how far away the proposed transferred model fares vs fully supervised models on the respective datasets. \n5. Sec 6.3: The definition of \"transfer\" is unclear.  Does it mean that only the navigation step is trained on R2R and CVDN while the representation step is used from RxR? Or are both steps retrained (in that case it isn't a transfer).  What about zero-shot transfer from RxR to R2R? How does the CLEAR approach fare on zero-shot? \n6. Sec N of the appendix includes another baseline (SimCSE, Gao et al) -- but this is missing from the tables in the main paper. Why? \n7. Are LSTMs a better choice for the navigation step? Would a transformer/attention mechanism be better suited for learning longer sequences? This architectural choice should be justified. \n8.

If not, how is it different? ",

Other tasks has the connotation of other V&L tasks such as VQA, captioning, ...  2.

You might want to test CLEAR on this benchmark if possible -- I'm not sure how practical it is, so I've not included this under \"Weaknesses\".  At the very least, it would be prudent to include this in related work. \n3. Overall, I would encourage the authors to re-think which analysis should go into the main paper and which in the appendix. In my opinion, every study that directly contributed to the 2 claims from the abstract, should be moved to the main paper.  The main contribution of this paper seems to be the multi-lingual training -- as such ablation studies about this part of the algorithm are more important that the ablation study about visual features.  (Table 9 for example) This paper makes a step in a very interesting direction -- however, I would like to see (1) re-organization of the analysis (between main and appendix), (2) focused and precise analysis of multi-lingual training, and (3) more details and exhaustive experiments in the transfer learning setup.

    "weaknesses": "While I do see the benefits of generating adversarial attacks and the advantages of building tools that guard against them, I find this line of work, and this paper as part of it, problematic.  In NLP, there is a growing interest in stress-tests that measure model performance in counterfactual scenarios (see CheckList, Counterfactual Invariance to stress tests, etc.). As opposed to adversarial attacks, such papers try to design counterfactual examples that we know we want to be robust to, and carefully measure model sensitivity to them. As this is a causal problem (estimating the effect of a counterfactual on an observed outcome), such methods examine performance with respect to modifications that we can reason about (i.e. flipping gender/race etc.). Reading this paper, I’m still not convinced that we should put such emphasis on examples that are modified based on word-level perturbations generated by a correlation-based search method. As such, I believe that training models to be robust to such attacks is somewhat tangential. Generally speaking, do we have a good reason to believe that these adversarial attacks are realistic? What do we learn from them on the model and its robustness and reliability?\nIf I put aside the power of adversarial attacks in uncovering model vulnerability, I do find this paper interesting and useful within this context. I suggest authors better address the causal nature of generating counterfactual examples, and try to analyze the sensitivity of their method to the type of attacks generated by SHARP. In doing that, this paper can certainly contribute to the growing literature on model vulnerability and robustness. ",

    "paper_summary": "The authors propose a black-box adversarial attack method for structured prediction tasks such as POS-tagging and dependency parsing. The authors formulate the adversarial attack under the black-box setting as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposed three search methods (beam search, Metropolis-Hastings sampling, and their combination) to generate textual adversarial examples. They advocate preserving the meaning and fluency of the original text when generating adversarial examples. However, it seems that the adversarial examples against dependency parsing models only need to preserve the same syntactic structure as the original ones, and the constraint on their similarity in semantic properties can be relaxed (Zheng et al., 2020). Besides, the novelty of this study is limited. The objective function used is similar to that of many previous studies. They claim that their attack method does not need to know the training dataset used by the victim models. However, it seems that they train the reference models on the same dataset used by the victim model (at least for the dependency parsing task). They did not compare their search strategy to others, such as genetic algorithm (Alzantot et al., 2018) both in the performance and computational cost.\nIn their revised version (2nd round), they only added a paragraph in the introduction (Line 54-75) and an experiment to investigate “the impact of metric for reference models” (Line 471-496). In the introduction, the authors claimed that structured prediction models are more vulnerable to adversarial examples than text classifiers. In the experiment, they introduced a metric, called OIoU (Opposite Intersection over Union), to evaluate “the diversity degree of reference parsers.” However, the questions raised in the 1st sound still have not been well answered.

    "paper_summary": "This paper focuses generally on the task of diverse decoding from conditional language generation models. Specifically, they introduce the idea of best-first search, which unlike traditional beam search involves exploring the output space using a depth-first path completion strategy. As this results in many candidate outputs, this work also utilizes path recombination to combine similar hypotheses. The recombination methods generalize previous work to account for merge a hypothesis with candidates from earlier timesteps, and then propagates any merges back through the original lattice; these changes allow for significantly more merges to occur. The authors evaluate the performance of these methods on document summarization and machine translation. ",
    "strengths": "This paper is very well-written, and clearly articulates the issues with not only beam search, but BFS approaches generally. The methods proposed are relatively novel, and show to explore significantly more of the search space than beam search, and explores in a more principal way than random sampling-based methods. The results indicate that using these methods results in significantly more diversity in the output candidates, which based on the higher oracle ROUGE scores, has the potential to improve performance given an additional re-ranking mechanism. This seems like it could be a non-trivial step forward for decoding strategies.\nThe figures are very compelling and help visualize the mechanisms that differentiate the proposed methods from previous work. Figures 11-13 in particular are fascinating visualizations of the different paths, I greatly appreciate the authors including them in the appendix. In addition, the included error analysis is helpful in identifying and motivating future work, potentially on when to reduce the aggressiveness of path merging. ",
    "weaknesses": "The paper makes several significant claims about best-first search and recombination being much more efficient than beam search, but the discussions on actual run-time are lacking. In the appendix the authors note that the best-first search code could be optimized relatively easily, but one question that doesn’t seem to be answered is: compared to the baseline approaches, how much longer does it take to generate outputs, at least as the method is implemented now?\nWhile the potential for significant improvement on quality scores is there due to the significantly higher portion of the search space explored, the authors don’t actually attempt any kind of re-ranking, which leaves an open question: are we able to actually extract the best output sequence from all the generated candidates? Did the authors try any simple re-ranking mechanisms to do this?\nFor evaluating diversity, one drawback of using distinct unigrams and bigrams is that it weights all n-grams that appear the same, which does not take into account the fact that infrequent n-grams the same. Thus, it would be good to also include Ent-n, and entropy-based metric introduced by Zhang et al (2018) that does account for this. ",

Without this     information, it is difficult to ascertain if the out-of-the-box models'     probing performance is at all good, or if it pales in comparison to simple     supervised baselines. I imagine this would be easy to achieve by fine-tuning     a model on some splits of the dataset, or training another architecture for     the task, e.g. a BiLSTM.  Lastly, it would be useful to see how their models fare on downstream tasks,     how they compare with other Chinese-language MLMs like RoBERTa, and what     implications this might hold for Chinese MLM design. Indeed, the authors     provide this information in the appendix, but nothing is shown in the main     body of the paper, and the discussion is limited to a sentence. ",

I don't think this setting is the default text-to-SQL in the current literature, so it'd be better to clarify this as early as possible.  For 2), the main arguments of the proposed system are that attention cannot capture alignments well because it's at the token level. But isn't the sequence tagging model used is also at the token level?  The second argument is that attention is prone to overfitting. I'm not convinced that we should attribute the overfitting of current parsers to attention mechanisms, and this paper does not provide any justification.  Maybe the authors should emphasize their way of incorporating alignments (alignments as context, and alignment augmentation), which I think are the main contribution of this work. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes to use multi-task learning to improve semantic dependency parsing. Based on the baseline biaffine dependency parser (Dozat and Manning, 2017), four auxiliary tasks are proposed: H (predicting the number of governors for each token), D (predicting the number of dependents for each token), S (predicting all the arc labels for each token in a classification manner), and B (predicting the number of incoming arcs with each label for each token). They evaluate the best configurations of multi-task learning (combinations of auxiliary tasks and final prediction flows) on one French and three English datasets and find that their methods outperform the vanilla biaffine parser.\nOverall, the paper is clear to understand and seems to perform solid empirical experiments. However, the proposed method seems too trivial and underperforms the state-of-the-art parser on the English datasets by a large margin. More in-depth analyses are also needed. ",

This improvement seems pretty trivial. It would be better if the authors could provide more thorough analyses of why these auxiliary tasks are helpful.\n- Underperform SOTA by a large margin: The methods underperform the SOTA parsers by a large margin because no POS or lemma information is used, and the authors claim their methods are directly usable with their system.

The curated questions cover different elements of a story, such as the identification of characters and the causal relationship among events, testing children’s RC skills.  Based on the newly collected dataset, the author proposes a pipeline-based system of question-answer pair generation (QAG) conditioned on given stories. The pipeline contains three components, including a heuristic-based answer generation model, a BART-based question generation model, and a BERT-based QA-pairs ranking model. The answer generation model extracts noun phrases and description of events with an off-the-shelf POS tagging model and a SRL model, respectively, as answer candidates. The QG model takes as input the concatenation of QA-pairs. The ranking model scores a list of QA-pairs.\nThe author conducts automatic and human evaluations. The proposed QAG system achieves higher ROUGE-L than the adopted baseline systems. Moreover, human evaluators verify that the QA pairs from the proposed system have higher readability and relevance with respect to the stories. ",

The evaluation of QAG methods is problematic. The author adopted the ROUGE-L metric for evaluation, but there is no justification that this metric is reliable in the addressed task: How likely a QA-pair with high ROUGE score can faithfully evaluate children’s RC skills? Although they conduct human evaluation, the evaluation metrics are not closely related to the educational purposes. \nThe author also mentions a user study: “A preliminary user study with 12 pairs of parents and children between the ages of 3-8 suggests that this application powered by our QAG system can successfully maintain engaging conversations with children about the story content.

E.g. a token like “Spielberg” may correlate with a “positive” label in a specific movie reviews dataset, but in itself the token is not a “genuine” indication of a positive review and relying on it may hurt a model's ability to generalize to new datasets or domains.\nThe authors present a method to identify tokens indicative of spurious correlations by: (i) identifying tokens that significantly affect model predictions (e.g. by looking at assigned attention, aggregated over a corpus); (ii) filter these tokens through cross-dataset analysis: removing tokens which are significant across multiple dataset (and thus unlikely to represent spurious correlations); and (iii) further filter the tokens through perturbation analysis: remove tokens which if replaced by their synonyms cause the classifier to change the predicted score significantly.\nThe authors discuss different methods to make models more robust based on the identified tokens. ",
    "strengths": "The paper is clear and well written and the research seems very sound: 1. The authors evaluate their methods on multiple text classification datasets 2.

They discuss the different steps of their method, clearly detailing how each is applied and how it affects the accuracy of the predictions. \n4. Effort is made to make the method as widely applicable as possible. e.g. the first step of identifying important tokens uses attention scores as a driving mechanism. However, to accommodate for models which do not use attention,  alternative methods to obtain important tokens are discussed and an experiment is conducted to measure their impact. ",
    "weaknesses": "Not a lot to say here as I think the researchers have done a thorough job. \n1. Personally, I’m somewhat skeptical that identifying tokens which are significant in aggregate across a corpus is a promising method to predict how a complex model will behave when these tokens are in a specific context (this is also pointed out by the authors as a limitation in their conclusions). In that sense, the impact of this research would be greater if the benefits shown when generalizing to new domains were higher (table 5). As is, the method seems like a non-trivial amount of work, to yield models which may be slightly more robust – a tradeoff which may suit some but not all.  2. I did not see an indication that code and data will be released for this paper and I would encourage the authors to add these. This is not only important to allow easy reproduction of the results, but also to allow readers to easily apply the method to their models, etc.\nStill, I think this is a very good paper and I don’t see any significant methodological issues.

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes a new problem of information extraction, text-to-table. Given a text, the model is required to produce the corresponding tables, including both schema and cell values. Two baselines have been developed for this task: a traditional information extraction baseline (relation extraction/name entity recognition); vanilla seq2seq model finetuned from pretrained language models. Apart from that, the authors propose two techniques, table constraint and relation embeddings for the seq2seq model to further boost the performance. The datasets are adapted from four existing table-to-text datasets, i.e., Rotowire, E2E, WikiTableText and WikiBio. The evaluation metric is calculated based on the number of correct non-header cells in the tables. Extensive experiments have been conducted, where the proposed method can beat the two baselines on average. ",
    "strengths": "1. This paper introduces a novel task, text-to-table. It is a reverse task of the original table-to-text task. It could benefit some downstream tasks like text mining. It feels like a good alternative to OpenIE. \n2. The authors propose two simple techniques, i.e., table constraint and relation embeddings, on top of seq2seq models for this task. Specifically, table constraint forces the rows to contain the same number of cells as the header. Relation embeddings are injected into the self-attention mechanism of the transformer to guide the model to specifically attend to the corresponding header when generating a cell value. The proposed methods can help beat the vanilla seq2seq baseline in experiments. \n3. The paper is clearly written except for several typos. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The problem formulation is flawed. The authors argue that one major motivation of this paper is to learn schema in a data-driven way other than laborious manual schema engineering. However, on the proposed four datasets, I feel that the schemas are somehow easy to learn. For example, on E2E, WikiTableText and WikiBio, only two columns are involved. According to my understanding, there is no discrepancy between training and testing w.r.t. the table schema. Things on the fourth dataset, Rotowire, feel more complicated. There are two tables, containing around 5 and 9 columns respectively. It's not clear whether a difference exists between training and testing. And the evaluation metric only considers the cell values while ignoring the schema. That's another reason I feel the schema is fairly easy to learn in the proposed setting. Furthermore, under the current setting, this problem sounds more like another type of machine reading that the model is asked to fill in the table as the schema is easy to predict. So I highly suggest considering schema generalization where the schemas differ between training and testing and additionally evaluating schema prediction. \n2. It's not surprising that the major performance contribution comes from the pretrained language model (BART). But compared to that, the gain obtained from the proposed method is marginal (Table 5). ",
    "comments": "1. In Section 3 (line 247-252), I am wondering tables are divided into three types. For me, one type (the column header) should work. \n2. Several typos exist in the paper. \n3. Like I suggest in the weaknesses, more exploration of schema learning and generalization will make this paper much stronger and more interesting. Another workaround is to rephrase the motivation to make this paper focus more on the non-header part. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper investigates the effects of moral framing on the persuasiveness of arguments relating to controversial topics. The work is comprised of three main parts: development of a technique for mining argumentative statements which correspond to a given moral position from text; integration with IBM Project Debater’s narrative generation API to generate arguments pro/con a given topic which match a given moral position; and, a detailed user-study assessing the impact of morally-framed arguments on audiences of different political ideologies.\nFor mining of morally framed statements, a BERT classifier based on data collected automatically using distant supervision was used. This approach is clearly explained and produces good results, with the proposed model outperforming both a lexicon-based baseline and existing work for four of the five moral foundations (for 'care' the lexicon-based approach performed better than the other two).\nThe user study described was carefully planned and executed. Although the results were not 100% conclusive, they suggest a clear impact of moral framing on both liberal and conservative audiences, with both being more affected by moral arguments, and liberals in particular finding arguments with relevant moral framing more effective.

As such, the user study included in this paper is extremely welcome and offers good indication that moral framing can impact how arguments are received. ",
    "weaknesses": "The only real concern here may be how well other factors are controlled for in the user study. With the method described for extracting morally framed argument components on a given topic, it is possible that other differences may also be present. Some of these may be connected to the moral position -- certain moral positions may bring with them certain phrasing or aspects of the topic that are more appealing to a given audience.

This isn't a deal breaker but it's uncomfortable, and the presentation doesn't really acknowledge that this is a preliminary evaluation (percentages with three significant figures, top numbers bolded, no statistics, no acknowledgment of the key status of particular individual items or raters as potential outliers).  It's also an evaluation on a proxy task.  The paper is forthright about the ethical issues that come with trying to persuade people but I found it a bit hard to understand what the ultimate vision was: a system that can provide people with the reasons for and against a proposal they'd find most compelling?  The arguments here seemed all to have the same direction -- all in favor, all against, but with different moral bases.  Why would you want such a one-sided summary? ",

Though Flooding method works very well if we search the flood level carefully, it is a very tedious job and could take lots of time if the size of the dataset is huge. Based on the agreement of different batches in the same epoch, the agreement between them could be used as an indicator of overfitting, and further applied to decide the flood level.  This paper tests the performance of the proposed indicator on a variety of tasks and achieved good results on some of them. Also, the analysis in the section 5 is also very helpful to the general audience as it includes detailed results and reasoning about why and how the proposed method works. ",
    "weaknesses": "I will list the detailed weakness in the next section.  In general, I think the claim in line 109 to 112 is incorrect (or overlap with the next claim). Based on my understanding, what this paper does simply is to provide an indicator to prevent tedious search on flood level. Yet the Flooding method, its ability to train a more robust model is NOT the contribution of this paper. In addition, some results in table 1 may not be reliable. ",
    "comments": "1. \" a smoother loss\" in line 184. To me the loss curves for different algorithms are all smooth, how do you define a **smoother** loss in this scenario? In addition, based on my understanding, a flooding-based algorithm will alternative between gradient descent and ascent when the loss is under some threshold, I was wondering what does the training loss look like under the same setting?  There is a text overlap between 0.00 and 0.03 around the origin.\n2. In Eq 13 around line 300: The summation is over $i$ and $j$ but they do not appear in $S_{batch accd}$, should they be $s$ and $t$? Also, it seems the computation of $S_{epoch accd}$ depends on four summation loops if we replace $S_{batch accd}$ by its definition, what is the computation cost for $S_{epoch accd}$?\n3. The reasoning between line 448 ~ 452 is confusing. Your re-implemented results are 97.0 and 91.6, which is better than Flooding-X, yet the claim in paper is \"our method is also the **best** among all the baseline methods\", which is a contradiction to me. Later the paper suggests that \"outperforming the **baselines** of our implementation.\", what is the difference between \"baseline\" and \"your re-implemented results\".  4. Some introduction to the datasets might also be helpful, such as the size of each dataset.  5. Why do you use BERT as the baseline method instead of RoBERTa, as RoBERTa outperforms BERT by a large margin in terms of clean accuracy on these datasets?\n6. I am a little confused about the test set performance on these GLUE datasets, are the labels to these sets not available to the public?\n7. The clean accuracy on SST-2, QNLI and MRPC is also confusing. Based on the results, vanilla BERT outperforms FreeLB on all three datasets, yet the FreeLB paper claims they could surpass RoBERTa baseline on all GLUE datasets, which makes me wonder if there are some implementation issues. I am also interested in the results on QQP and RTE, but they are not reported here.  8. In figure 3, the test loss increases after some epoch, will the clean accuracy drop with the increased test loss? If not why do you use test loss as the measurement of overfitting?  9.

Flooding is a regularizer that prevents the model from converging to zero training loss by choosing an appropriate *flooding level*. Moreover, according to the authors, flooding encourages the model to converge to a flat region of the loss landscape.  The authors find that fine-tuning BERT-base with flooding significantly improves its robustness, and improves over all baselines in most settings, against three adversarial attacks (TextFooler, TextBugger, and BERTAttack) from the TextAttack framework.\nBeyond the experimental contribution, the authors also propose an efficient way to find the *flooding level*, a crucial hyperparameter of the flooding method, based on *gradient accordance*. Moreover, they convincingly analyse and discuss their contributions.\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08709 ",

This might be an interesting method for other NLP settings beyond robust training.  - The experimental results are strong and the authors provide additional analysis investigating their proposed methods.

This would illustrate if the optimal flood level generalizes across attacks.\n- Figure 3 is a bit hard to read. Maybe move MRPC to a separate figure and put it in the appendix?\nThe authors might be interesting in this concurrent work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04448) from the computer vision community  that studies the relationship between adversarial robustness and flatness.

Since several words in the rewritten utterance come from the incomplete utterance, a lot of previous work has modeled this task as some sort of editing task. Following the same line, this paper proposes to leverage a picker and a generator to jointly predict the final utterance. Experimental results on two benchmarks are used to validate the effectiveness of the method. ",
    "strengths": "The paper is well written and easy to follow. The idea of combining the picker and the generator is straightforward and can be integrated easily with generative language models. The experimental results on four datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n--- Regarding the concerns I raised in my previous review (Review `XYZ`), I think the resubmission addresses some of my concerns in an appropriate way (see below).\n> 1. This paper claims that the previous method is over fine-tuned on specific datasets (Line 69-71). However, according to my knowledge, the baseline model RUN (Liu et al. 2020) was experimented on four different datasets, including two used in this paper. Why not report experimental results on another two datasets? I suspect that the experimental results in this paper may be also over fine-tuned for specific datasets.\nThis paper adds to the experiments on the proposed datasets, and the results look promising and make me feel more convincing.\n> 2. There are some issues in the experimental setting. First, the comparison to baselines are unfair. If the method in this paper leverages T5 as the encoder, it should at least try to employ the same one to the most advanced baseline (e.g., SARG). Otherwise, the comparison is unfair. Second, according to my knowledge, the reported F3 performance in RUN (Liu et al. 2020) is 47.7 (higher than this paper's result). However, the reproduced result in this paper is 45.1 using the author's code. I am wondering if the paper tuned the baseline performance as in their method.\nThis paper addresses some issue raised by my previous review. For example, they double checked the baseline performance and reported the ones from the original paper. Although the paper did not do a comparison with SARG (plus T5), it also showed sufficient superiority under the limited data setting. ",
    "weaknesses": "Although I am leaning towards accepting the paper, I still doubt the contribution of the picker for the generator. This picker only affects the generator if the T5 encoding representation is altered accordingly. I think the connection between the picker and the generator is somewhat weak. Meanwhile, the proposed `soft` labeling method seems useless, compared with the straightforward `hard` labeling. Considering the `hard` labeling method seems to just pick overlapped words between the incomplete utterances and the rewritten utterances, the nolvety of the proposed method seems smaller.\nBesides the above, the contribution part (line 99-111) is not well structured.

    "paper_summary": "The authors propose a new method for the KG-to-text generation task. Similar to earlier work, their method S-OSC leverages pre-trained LMs (PLMs) and models the generation task as a sequence-to-sequence task by linearizing the KG triples. However, unlike previous PLM based methods, S-OSC pays specific attention to two things: (1) order of triples in the linearized sequence should match the ordering in GT sentence (2) part-of-speech tags can help the model know when to copy and when to generate new words. By having additional models/training procedures for these sub-goals, S-OSC is able to outperform the state-of-the-art on 2 public KG-to-text datasets (WebNLG and DART). ",

For DART, there seems to be a significant jump compared to the baselines; however, the model by Li et al [1] is absent from this comparison (Table 2). \n2.

I would like to keep my original score. \n---- This paper presents a lightweight method to train a controllable text generation model by learning small prefix vectors on top of a frozen LM such as GPT-2. The parameter-efficient prefix vectors are of the same design as the prefix-tuning paper (Li and Liang 2021), while this paper proposes to focus on using prefixes to steer the LM generation process according to given attributes & aspects, such as sentiment (pos./neg.) and topics (sports/world). The author(s) argue(s) that the proposed method is also the first work to explore multi-aspect control.\nThe prefixes can be learned either without attribute labels (via label variables; similar to the VQ-VAE method) or with attribute labels (via a margin loss). The experiments are conducted over multiple datasets for both single and multiple aspect control for text generation. Perplexity and attribute relevance are used for automatic evaluation; Attribute relevance and linguistic quality are two human-evaluation metrics. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, although there are still some limitations (e.g., tending to shift to movie reviews regardless of prompts). ",
    "strengths": "- The proposed method is a natural extension of prefix-tuning Li and Liang (2021), which focuses on parameter-efficiently learning of conditional NLG tasks (e.g., summarization). This paper, instead, focuses on the controllable free-text generation with given attributes.\n- Benefiting from the parameter efficiency of Li and Liang (2021)'s work, the proposed method in this paper can mix multiple aspects for controlling. Also, the inference speed is maintained --- comparable to the original base model GPT-2.\n- The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method in most cases, outperforming several baseline methods in automatic evaluation metrics. ",
    "weaknesses": "- The modeling of the mixture of multiple aspects is not explored deeper enough, and thus the so-called \"first to explore\" (in the Introduction) sounds more like an overclaim to me.\n- The qualitative results (Table 5) and human evaluation both show that there are still limitations of the proposed method and the improvement is not so obvious.\n- Given the arguments about the downstream applications (Line 116-117), I would like to see more downstream performance of such controllable text generation models.

    "paper_summary": "This paper provides evidence for the hypothesis that learned representations in BERT and RoBERTa encode abstract information about argument structure. Evidence comes from two experimental methods loosely inspired by psycholinguistics: In experiment 1, inspired by the sentence sorting task, they find that similarity scores are higher for representations of sentences (i.e. an average of token embeddings) with the same argument structure (but different verbs) than for sentences with the same verb (but different argument structures). In experiment 2, inspired by jabbewocky priming studies, they find that representations of verbs placed into a novel (and usually ungrammatical or incoherent) syntactic frame have representations that more closely resemble verbs that canonically appear in that frame.  The authors argue that these results provide evidence for abstract constructions corresponding to different argument structures, as proposed in Construction Grammar. There is also evidence that abstractness of argument structure in representations increases as a function of the amount of pretraining: LMs with more pretraining data show a stronger tendency to group sentences by argument structure than by verb identity. ",
    "strengths": "Overall, I think this is a nice paper, with a few clear opportunities for improvement.\n- The representation of argument structure is an underexplored topic in linguistic analysis of LMs in my opinion (considering its importance in linguistics), so this paper is helping to fill that gap.  - The results provide converging evidence that argument structure is encoded in contextual embeddings (though other interpretations remain possible).\n- The experimental paradigms are simple (both rely on comparisons of Euclidean distance in an embedding space), but novel in their choice of which quantities to compare.\n- The paper studies models trained both on different sized datasets and on different languages. This inspires greater confidence in the replicability of the results, and is useful from a cognitive modeling perspective. ",
    "weaknesses": "My main concern is that the experiments do nothing to distinguish between the main claim that argument structure constructions (a la construction grammar) are encoded in models, from an alternative explanation that surface features correlated with (but certainly not) argument structure constructions are what these similarity metrics are picking up on. This is a pernicious problem with template data, but a serious one. For instance, only ditransitive sentences had two proper names (or two animate nouns), only resultatives had adjectives, and only caused-motion sentences had the word \"the\" twice (or two inanimate nouns). Several more such features can be thought of that would identify the template. If the confluence of these features has a greater impact on the sentence representation than the lexical identity of these features, we would still see that sentences with the same argument structure are ranked more similar, but it would not be evidence that an abstract construction is represented, thereby undermining the main claim. ",
    "comments": "Suggestions To address the problem of surface features, there should be a set of control stimuli that preserve many of the relevant surface features while eliminating the possibility of an argument structure construction. This could come in a few forms: - Shuffling the words/phrases in the stimuli - Interleaving the words/phrases of the stimuli with a random word list If LMs still rank altered sentences generated from the same template closer than sentences with the same verb, then it is clearly the function words, number of phrases of a certain type, or order of phrases that determines similarity.\nLn 346: This method for producing sentence embeddings is not immediately problematic, but still just one of many ways that could affect results. What about repeating this at different layers (including the final layer), or studying [CLS] in BERT? Or S-BERT, which is pretrained to produce meaningful sentence embeddings?\nLn 489: Using just the first subword embedding is just one arbitrary choice of several. What about the last subword embedding, an average of all subword embeddings?\nComments - Ln 41: I don’t think these works assume a generative framework. They just acknowledge contrasts in acceptability (which are historically used as evidence in generative grammar…and in other frameworks).\n- Ln 139: This is an uncharitable misrepresentation of lexicalist theories.

    "paper_summary": "The paper focuses on the topic of *argument structure constructions* (ASCs), an important topic in the framework of construction grammars. In construction grammar theory it is argued that the argument structure of a verb is not governed by the lexical entry of the verb itself, but by more abstract argument structure constructions that are independent of the verb. A rich body of work has addressed this topic and it has been demonstrated that humans process argument structure in a way that is explained well by the theory of ASCs.  The authors borrow several experiments from this body of (psycho)linguistic research to assess to what extent current language models comply with construction grammar theory. After a comprehensive background section they introduce a setup consisting of two experiments.  The first experiment is based on the sentence sorting task of Bencini and Goldberg (2020). In the original task 16 sentences are created by combining four verbs with four constructions, after which a participant is asked to sort them based on sentence meaning. If the sorting is done based on the construction type, and not on verb form, this is taken as evidence as abstract argument structure playing a more central role for sentence meaning than verb lexicality does. This paper applies this setup to LMs by clustering the 4x4 sentences based on their (averaged) sentence representations. It is found that all models that were considered (both mono- and multilingual) yield clusters that are closer to construction sorting than verb sorting. This is taken as first evidence of ASCs playing a role in LMs as well.\nThe second experiment is based on that of Johnson and Goldberg (2013). The original experiment utilized a priming-based task to probe for the reality of ASCs. A participant was provided a nonsense sentence of a certain construction, after which they were asked to determine whether a string of characters was a real English word or a non-word. It was shown that the response time for words that are considered prototypical for a certain construction type (e.g. _give_ for ditransitives) was significantly lower for congruent construction-word pairs. In this paper this setup is adapted by comparing the contextualised representation of a semantically implausible verb in a certain ASC with the averaged representation of a prototypical verb. By comparing the similarities of congruent and incongruent construction-verb pairs it can be shown that the argument structure is embedded within the representation of the nonsensical verb, and the authors find significant evidence for this to be the case. ",
    "strengths": "The paper is structured clearly and well written, making it easy to follow the line of argumentation. This paper provides an interesting angle to the recent research direction of applying theories derived from (psycho)linguistics to neural LMs, and manages to find intriguing evidence as to what type of abstract linguistic information is encoded in the representations of a language model.  I expect this paper will open the door for exciting future work that will gain more elaborate insights into the mechanisms deployed by LMs to deal with structural, abstract features of language. The authors show that the rich body of work within psycholinguistics can be directly applied to the current generation of LMs, and I look forward to seeing this direction be explored in more detail by future work. ",
    "weaknesses": "The amount of background provided can be reduced, and consists of quite a few detailed descriptions of topics and experiments that are not directly related to the experiments of the paper (e.g. the Priming paragraph at L210, Novel verbs paragraph at L224). The space that is currently occupied by this extensive background could be used more efficiently, and cutting it down a bit opens up space for additional experiments.  The ‘Jabberwocky constructions’ experiment is quite prone to several potential confounds that need to be explored in more detail in order to ensure that the current set of results truly hints at ‘the neural reality of argument structure constructions’. The fact that the contextualised embeddings of verbs in the same syntactic configuration is highly similar isn’t that surprising in itself (as is noted by the authors as well). The authors decided to drop the ‘priming’ component of the original paper in order to adapt the experiment to LMs, but there are other options that can be explored to align the setup more closely to the original (see section below for some ideas). ",
    "comments": "### Comments / Questions - Could the results of the Sentence Sorting be driven by the fact that sentence embeddings are obtained by averaging over word embeddings? It seems that this procedure would be quite prone to simply cluster based on features stemming from individual tokens, instead of a more general abstract signal. I could imagine that in a BERT-like architecture the representation at the [CLS] position might serve as a sentence representation as well.\n- Alternatively, would it be possible to set up the sentence sorting experiment in such a way that the lexical overlap in between sentences is limited? This is common in structural priming experiments as well, and models are known to rely heavily on lexical heuristics. ,\n- Did you consider different measures of similarity in the Jabberwocky experiment? Euclidean distance might not be the most perfect measure for expressing similarity, and I would suggest looking into alternatives as well, like cosine similarity.  - A bit pedantic, but Jabberwocky words are non-existing nonce words, whereas the setup that the authors arrived at is only semantically nonsensical, yet still made up of existing words (a la ‘Colorless green ideas’). Referring to them as Jabberwocky (L.458) would give the impression of actually using nonce words.\n- How many ASCs have been argued to exist (within English)? Is there a reason why the 4 constructions used in Case Study 1 (_transitive, ditransitive, caused-motion, resultative_; L.165), are slightly different from Case Study 2 (_ditransitive, resultative, caused-motion, removal_; Table 2)?\n--- ### Suggestions: - L.490: “we take the embedding of the first subword token as the verb embedding.” It is also quite common in cases like that to average over the subword representations, which is done e.g. by [Hewitt and Manning (2019, footnote 4)](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1419.pdf).\n- I suggest not phrasing the Jabberwocky experiment as “probing” (L.444 ‘method to probe LMs’, L.465 ‘probing strategy’, etc.), given the connotation this term has with training small classifiers on top of a model’s hidden state representations.\n- Could the ‘priming’ aspect of Johnson and Goldberg (2013) in the Jabberwocky experiment perhaps be emulated more closely by framing it as a “Targeted Syntactic Evaluation” task (akin to Marvin & Linzen (2018), a.o.). In the context of priming, a similar setup has recently been utilised by [Sinclair et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14989.pdf). One could compare the probability of _P(gave | She traded her the epicenter. He)_ to that of _P(gave | He cut it seasonal. She)_, and likewise for the other 2 constructions. This way you wouldn’t run into the confounding issues that stem from using the contextualisation of ‘gave’.  - An additional experiment that might be interesting to explore is by probing for construction type across layers at the position of the verb. In the ‘Jabberwocky’ setup one would expect that at the word embedding level construction information can’t be present yet, but as it is contextualised more and more in each layer the ASC information is likely to increase gradually. Would also be interesting than to see how the curve of a jabberwocky verb compares to that of a sensical/prototypical verb (like _gave_): there is probably _some_ degree of argument structure already encoded in the word embedding there (as a lexicalist would argue), so I would expect probing performance for such verbs to be much higher at lower levels already.  - Adding to the previous point: probing in itself would not even be necessary to gain insight into the layerwise contextualisation; some of the current experiments could be conducted in such a fashion as well.\n--- ### Typos/Style: Very well written paper, no remarks here.

    "paper_summary": "The authors are presenting a paper on two multilingual probing tasks, e.g. sentence sorting and modeling of priming of Jabberwocky sentences, in order to test  the reality of argument constructions in the sentence embedding representations of modern pre-trained language models.  Several models trained on different amounts of data have been tested, with the goal of simulating different levels of proficiency in human speakers.\nIn the first sentence sorting experment, inspired by the experiment by Bencini and Goldberg (2000), the authors generate sentences by using verbs that are compatible with 4 different constructions and create sentence embeddings by averaging the token vectors. The results of vector clustering show that in all the tested languages sentences that share the same constructions are more similar than sentences sharing the same main verb, with the only exception of the LM model trained with the  smallest amount of data. Such a finding is certainly interesting as a construction-oriented preference in the original task was observed only in more proficient speakers.\nFor the Jabberwocky experiment, as a difference from the Johnson and Goldberg (2013) setting, sentences for each construction are generated by randomly filling real words in the templates. The contextual embeddings of such sentences are then compared to prototype embeddings of the constructions, which are obtained by averaging the verb embeddings of a prototypical verb for each construction. The authors found that for congruent prototype-Jabberwocky pairings distance are significantly lower, even in the scenario where construction prototypes are built by using relatively low frequency verbs.  The paper is overall well-structured and the experiments are clear and well-presented. Personally, I am not aware of any other work that probes contextualized word representations for argument constructions, and I appreciate that the authors take their inspiration directly from the psycholinguistic literature on the psychological reality of argument constructions. \nAlthough I would still have a couple of questions (see the section below), I feel I can say this work deserves publication.

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes a solution for \"Contrastive Conflicts\". What exactly are “Contrastive Conflicts”? They occur when multiple questions are derived from a passage, each with different semantics. The questions are going to be close to the passage in representation space and by transitivity they are going to be close among themselves even though they are semantically different (Transitivity Conflict). In addition to this, if multiple questions derived from the same passage are in the same training batch, then the questions will see that passage as both positive and negative (In-Batch Conflict).\nThe solution proposed by the paper is to use smaller granularity units, i.e. contextualized sentences. Per sentence representations are computed by using per sentence special indicator tokens, then a similar approach to DPR is used to finetune sentence representations. Because different questions have answers in different sentences the contrastive conflict is generally resolved.\nImprovements are reported on NQ, TriviaQA and SQuAD, especially on SQuAD where conflicts are reported to be severe (i.e. often multiple different questions are extracted from the same passage). Extensive experiments show that the method does well even in transfer learning. ",
    "strengths": "Strengths: - The paper obtains small but convincing improvements on NQ and TriviaQA, and large but a bit puzzling results on SQuAD (considering that one of the baselines does not match the DPR paper and that SQuAD can benefit dramatically from combining DPR with BM25, but it is not done in this paper).\n- The paper presents many interesting ablations and transfer learning experiments that help further convince the reader of the efficacy of the method. ",
    "weaknesses": "Weaknesses: - Retrieving (avg # sentences) * 100 sentences (see section 3.3) instead of just 100 sentences seems to be a bit of a cheat. For a strict comparison to DPR, Top-20 and Top-100 performance should be reported with exactly those numbers of retrieved elements and without post-processing on larger sets of retrieved passages. One could argue that allowing for more expensive passage retrieval is what is giving the improvements in this paper, other than for SQuAD where the lower granularity does seem to be helping, except it doesn’t help as much as BM25.\n- The idea of having more granular representations for passage retrieval is far from new. The authors do cite DensePhrases (Lee et al. 2021), but don’t mention that it’s already at lower granularity than passage level. They could also cite for example ColBERT (Khattab et al. 2021).\n- The big improvement reported in Table 2 for SQuAD “Single” is a bit confusing since it relies on a Top-20 number that is much lower that what is reported on the DPR paper (although this seems to be a common problem). On the positive side, the number reported for SQuAD “Multi” matches the DPR paper. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper is about determining the syntactic ability of two Dutch variants of transformer based language model BERT: BERTje and RobBERT. The authors use a Multiple Context Free Grammar (MCFG) formalism to model two patterns of Dutch syntax: control verb nesting and verb raising. These rule-based grammatical models are used to generate a test set which is limited by a bound on recursion depth and populated from a lexicon. For evaluation, each verb occurrence garners a prediction of which referential noun phrase is selected by it, and the resulting accuracy is reported. The authors show results that demonstrate drastically worse performance as recursive depth and number of noun phrases increase, and conclude that the models have not properly learned the underlying syntax of the linguistic phenomena they describe; ie discontinuous constituents/cross-serial dependencies.

    "paper_summary": "The paper discusses the introduction into direct speech translation models of contrastive learning methods that aim at reducing the difference between the encoded representations of speech and text with the same content. The main goal is to increase the transfer learning benefits of cross-modal systems, trained both with textual and audio data, and hence obtaining better performance especially in ST, leveraging large parallel textual corpora, which are easily available on the contrary of ST data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated in different data conditions, comparing it with several previous works and with a thorough analysis targeted to validate the claim that similarity of the representations of the same sentences with different modalities is actually increased. ",
    "strengths": "The approach proposed in the paper is interesting and the results reported are promising. The main strength of the paper in my opinion is the analysis section on the modality, which demonstrates that the proposed method actually brings the benefits it was introduced for. Moreover, it motivates a possible future adoption of the proposed architecture in application scenarios where the similarity between the representations of textual and audio versions of the same content is needed. ",
    "weaknesses": "The main problem of the paper in my opinion is related to the data Augmentation: I have not been able to understand exactly which are the data augmentation methods used, and their impact on the scores (line 461-470 were quite obscure to me) and how this affects the comparison with other methods. In other words, the higher scores obtained with respect to other works cited in Table 1 are due to the contrastive learning method or to the different data augmentation methods? The comparison with some of the reported works is already not fair due to the different data condition (the usage of external speech data). It would have been better to compare with the other architectures/works repeating their experiments with the same data conditions (including data augmentation methods).\nThe reproducibility of this work would not be easy, since the code is not open sources and some details of the experimental settings are not very clear:  - line 184-186: the 2 convolutions are said to have stride 4, and that in total they shrink the input by a factor of 4. The two claims are contrasting. I guess the 2 convolutions actually have stride 2. 4 is the kernel size maybe? \n - line 236-251: the same letters (u and v) are used for different things and v is sometimes treated as a variable, sometimes as a function. This section could be more clear with a simpler notation. \n - line 342-344: Why using 10k as vocabulary size? Most of the works in literature (and also cited in table 1) use 8k (eg. Wang et al. 2020a), as also suggested in https://aclanthology.org/2020.amta-research.13/. In addition, it is not clear to me on which data the vocabulary was built: on MuST-C or on the WMT corpus? ",
    "comments": "Why did you introduce a parallelism between neural networks and the human brain in the introduction? This parallelism is questionable, as there are contrasting feelings and opinions about it. I am not sure it is adding anything to the motivation of the work, but it may rise concerns.\nIn the related works, among the many multi-task frameworks the addition of the CTC loss is not cited.\nIn lines 370-374, the paper claims that MT performance is not affected, but there is no evidence of it in the paper: the MT results are missing.\nIn the caption of table 2, what does strong mean? There are stronger cascade systems (e.g. you cited Bentivogli et al., 2020, whose cascade scores 28.8).\nIn line 152 the citation format is not correct. \nIn line 162, \"in\" -> \"into\". \nIn line 172, \"fout\" -> \"four\" In line 264 I guess a part of the sentence is missing: how is the contrastive loss computed?

    "paper_summary": "This paper deals with the Cross-Lingual Event Detection (CLED) task where only source language data is available for training but the model is then tested on a target language. The paper claims that their intuition is using unlabelled data in training (line 097-101). They use adversarial language adaptation (ALA) to learn language-invariant representations out of unlabeled bilingual text data. The main contribution of the paper is it proposes to use Optimal Transport (OT) for selecting samples for ALA training. Introducing ALA into CLED itself can be seen as a minor contribution. ",
    "strengths": "1. The paper proposes to leverage Optimal Transport (OT) to find similar samples. This is new knowledge to me. Previously I only know Optimal Transport (OT) or Wasserstein Distance is used in Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) which aligns real and fake image spaces. I did not see papers that use OT to search similar data samples before. I also appreciate the way that the paper draw samples in equation (3) and calculate p(s) and p(t) in 2.4.2 which is clever.  2. The main results in 3.2 looks promising. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The paper claims that it exploits unlabelled target language data. However, in line 363, it seems that the paper actually uses event-presence labels $e_{i}$ for each target language sample. First, $e_{i}$ is probably extracted directly from labels $y_{i}$; it is when $y_{i}$ says that some word is an event trigger that one can know that $e_{i}=1$. So, for target language data, their labels are actually used in an indirect way. Thus the method is not totally using pure \"unlabelled\" target language data as the paper claims. Second, I think $e_{i}$ provides super crucial information which might be responsible for most of the gain derived.  To make fair comparisons with the baselines, I think baseline methods BERT-CRF in section 3.2 and the BERT-CRF+MLM in 3.4 should also see $e_{i}$ labels.  2. Also concerning $e_{i}$ in weakness point 1 above, it is not known how $e_{i}$ and $e_{i}$'s distributions look like at all. I could only guess $e_{i}$ is 0,1 binary variables? Since all SRC and TRG data comes from Cross-Lingual Event Detection datasets, maybe most samples do have an event trigger and thus most $e_{i}$s equal 1.  3. It is confusing in line 339: s$\\sim$p(s) and t$\\sim$p(t). Do p(s) and p(t) here the ones calculated and updated in equation (6-7) in lines 369-370? Or maybe it is fixed since each sample already has a ground truth $e_{i}$. If it is the former case, I think it might be a little weird to predict the p(s) and p(t) which the paper uses to draw samples, because p(s) and p(t) are already given since $e_{i}$s are known for all samples?  4. The authors did not justify why Optimal Transport (OT) is used and did not elaborate on what are OT's advantages. One simple substitute for OT is average euclidean distance or average cosine similarity, which can be used to replace the paper's equation (8). There are more substitutes to OT, such as the KL divergence or the Jensen-Shannon divergence (which are commonly used to make comparisons with OT). It is worth comparing OT with say, Euclidean distance, KL divergence as a side experiment. All these simple substitutes are probably super-efficient and quicker to compute than OT.  5. It is not known if the OT sample selection process in 2.4.3 only runs once or runs iteratively as EP module is updated during the training steps. Are optimizing the loss of equation (10), i.e. the training steps, and solving OT in equation (3) conducted by turns iteratively? It will be much easier for readers to know the whole process if more details and a flow chart can be added. Furthermore, what is the runtime for solving the entropic regularized discrete OT problem, and the runtime for OT sample selection?\n6. It is claimed in lines 128-132 that \"it would be beneficial for the LD to be trained with examples containing events\". The statement in lines 137-148 also focuses only on LD. Why only LD benefits from seeing examples containing events? Do the text encoders also benefit from seeing these examples? A clue that the encoder might benefit from unlabelled data is in 3.4's result where simply MLM fine-tuning can derive considerable gains.\n7. In section 3.4, the result shows that simple MLM fine-tuning on unlabelled target language data derives considerable gains against BERT-CRF baseline. I was curious if the authors could do BERT-CRF + MLM + EP like in equation (10), can the performance be better than ALA? If true, it might show that a simple MLM is better than adversarial training. ",
    "comments": "1. The writing is not fluent enough. Some typos and awkward/redundant/unnatural sentences such as lines 019, 041-043. \n2. Using Optimal Transport (OT), or more specifically leveraging the Wasserstein Distance, in GAN is first seen in the Wasserstein GAN paper, i.e. WGAN (Arjovsky et al. ICML 2017). It might be beneficial to discuss WGAN a bit or even add WGAN as a baseline method. \n3. The paper should elaborate on OT in both the introduction and the methodology parts and should provide more details and justifications for OT. \n4. In equation (4), L2 distance is used. In OT,  earth mover's distance is more common. What is the benefit of L2 distance? \n5. I hope to see the authors' response in resubmission (if rejected) or clarifications in the camera-ready (if accepted) to remove my concern. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper addresses training models to be robust to adversarial perturbations for sentiment analysis tasks. The authors first identify two limitations that exists with prior works: (i) adversarial perturbations for text often require a large number of search steps; and (ii) while expanding the search space for adversarial perturbations to augment the training set may improve robustness of the trained model to such perturbations, it could also hurt model performance on the clean data. To address this issue, the paper introduces friendly adversarial data augmentation (FADA) and geometry-aware adversarial training (GAT). The key idea behind FADA is to create adversarial examples in a way that takes them closer to the decision boundary but does not push them over it (as that would harm performance on original test set). Following creation of such adversarial examples in one go (rather than the dynamic approach adopted in prior work), the authors optimize the model using GAT, making it computationally efficient. Experiments on IMDb and SST-2 datasets show that adversarially trained models using GAT outperforms several strong baselines against five attack methods (TextFooler, TextBugger, BAE, PSO, and FastGA). The authors also present several ablation studies to identify the effect of each component in GAT, finding positive contribution from each. Additional analysis on step size, number of steps, training epochs, etc. is also presented in the paper. Overall, I think it is a very good paper that merits acceptance to an ACL venue. ",
    "strengths": "- The paper is well motivated and well written (except some minor issues I've laid below). It provides enough background to a first time reader and is very easy to follow. With motivation from the toy example, going into the experiments on SST-2 and IMDb datasets, the results are very interesting and provide good evidence in support of the efficacy of the proposed method. I do think the paper could be restructured in a way that highlights the contributions better than they have been in the current version.\n- The authors complement the experiments with a thorough analysis to determine the effect of several choices made in constructing adversarial augmentations. The ablation studies also provide a good insight into the effectiveness of GAT.\n- There are limitations of the proposed method and the paper, but to the authors' credit they offer a discussion of some of these limitations in the paper itself (thus warranting a mention in Strengths from my perspective). ",
    "weaknesses": "- There seems to be a slight disconnect between the motivation and the actual experiments. While the toy setup used to motivate the paper shows dramatic performance decline on clean data, that drop isn't as dramatic on the actual dataset as shown in the experiments.\n- The experiments are limited to only sentiment analysis as a task. I would have liked to see some \"more difficult\" tasks as well, such as NLI.\n- I don't understand why the results on RoBERTa and DeBERTa are restricted to only SST-2. I would have liked to see RoBERTa or DeBERTa be the default model for experiments on both SST-2 and IMDb over BERT as we know from prior work that these two methods perform better than BERT.\n- The paper lacks any error analysis to see cases where prior methods fail but this method works well and vice versa. Aside from a practical utility offered by this method, I'm not sure if I am gaining any insights from the paper. I'd like to see how the accuracy sees significant shifts by just changing one word, some qualitative analysis (or examples to highlight this) would have supported the argument better.

The authors argue that adversarial examples across the decision boundary, in fact, are harmful to models' performance, which is supported by a controlled experiment. These findings motivate the introduction of a so-called geometry-aware adversarial training (GAT) equipped with proposed \"friendly\" adversarial data augmentation (FADA). Evaluated on SST-2 and IMDb, language models fine-tuned with this method show stronger robustness. A thoughtful ablation study follows to analyze the impact of some related factors (e.g., search steps, step size, training epochs). ",
    "strengths": "1). Borrowing the concept of geometry, it is an interesting research topic to analyze the quality of generated adversarial examples against the decision boundary. 2). It is a nice try to introduce the motivation of this work by an experiment on a toy set at the very beginning. 3). To promote the robustness of pre-trained language models, GAT with FADA is proposed and achieves better defense performance on SST-2 and IMDb against three wide-used attacks. ",
    "weaknesses": "1). Although the hypothesis is quite interesting, it is not well verified by the designed experiment. As pointed out in Section 3.1, models in conventional methods are trained on the original training set in addition to the generated adversarial examples. In contrast, the base model is trained on the adversarial set only. It is better to compare the model trained on the original dataset with that trained on the mixture so as to highlight the impact of the augmented adversarial examples. Since this experiment serves as the motivation throughout this work, it is critical to make it more convincing. 2). The statement (title or scope) needs more extensive experiments to support. The overall goal of this work is to improve the robustness of pre-trained language models, while RoBERT and DeBERTa are only examined on SST-2, and large versions are not touched. Evaluation on only SST-2 and IMDb ( two classification tasks) seems weak. 3). It is encouraged to introduce the motivation by a lightweight experiment, but the Introduction is not the appropriate place for it. It is said \"achieved with ADA, FADA, and the original training set\" in the caption of Figure 1, but I can only see two pairs of learning curves. FADA should be defined formally in Section 3.1. The experiments conducted in line 207-216 is unclear without proper reference to either tables or figures. Is it the same as the one in the Introduction?

If so, how do we know that training for another 100-200k steps alone might not account for the score improvement.\n- Some explanations of techniques are too brief, e.g., Focal and Anti-focal loss are described exactly the same (same formula and even hyperparameters) yet give different results, Self-paced learning receives a too-brief single sentence description.  Also, section 5.4 and appendix C are not detailed enough to understand the experiment. ",
    "comments": "- I'd like to see some discussion/visualization of learning curves, since the kind of differences in scores reported can be due to converged vs. non-converged models - Are the Self-paced learning results all from another paper?  In Table 1 only the base results are flagged as such, but in table 6, it looks like both results are.\n- Using p(x|y_<j) -- the source probability conditioned on the target prefix -- seems a strange choice.  I would think the unconditional source probability would be better.  Yet, based on Eq 7, the source probability factor is cancelled out anyway, so it doesn't really matter.\n- Eq 15 and 16 seem identical, but they are called \"focal loss\" and \"anti-focal loss\".  Shouldn't they be opposite?  Otherwise how are they different in practice… even the hyperparams from the appendix are largely the same.  Please highlight the difference in the description in Section 4.4.\n- Typo: +0.55 -> 0.54 BLEU (line 473) - Section 5.4 - What is really happening here?  How are these priors calculated and used in training?  Is this related to equation 18 (from Appendix C)?  Also, the LM prior seems to give equivalent results to the \"prior selection\" and even to the full CBMI adaptive training method, why is this LM prior not compared to the LM prior in table 1?\n- Are the CMBI values used in figure 4 and prior selection the non-normalized values - Appendix C:  hard to understand how Figure 5 is produced, since CBMI values are calculated per token, not per sentence.  Also how is equation 18 used? \nFigure 4 shows the LM prior dominating < 0, the TM prior dominating > 8, and CMBI prior dominating between them.  Why dos the \"prior selection\" method then have the TM prior between 0 and 6, and the CMBI prior above 6?  This doesn't match figure 4 (at least as labeled). ",

The authors collect VHED, a dataset containing semantic quality scores for several human and machine-generated stories. Thanks to their data collection, they are able to collect very fine-grained evaluation data for 13,875 story pairs. An error analysis of the collected dataset is performed which sheds some light on the properties of the stories. First of all, human references are not always the best reference: 38% of the machine-generated stories are actually better than human-generated ones. Additionally, 79.8% of machine-generated stories have at least one error (according to their detailed classification).   Using such a dataset, they develop VRank as a reference-free model for story generation evaluation. This is a model finetuned on the VHED dataset starting from the SIMCSE pretrained model. The model receives in input the two stories (separated by [SEP]) and generates a score to predict the ranking gap. The model is then finetuned by minimising the MSE loss. The results of the evaluation show that Vrank has better performance than model-based and n-gram based evaluation methods. Another interesting part of their analysis is that they use their model for evaluating text-only stories as well showing very promising results. ",

Compared to metrics traditionally used for caption generation evaluation like METEOR and ROUGE-L, the authors new metric performs better. They also evaluate on a non-visual corpus, and demonstrate that their model also works to evaluate in that case. ",
    "strengths": "I liked this work! I suspect that some controversy because the author's metric is i) model-based; and ii) trained directly on human ratings, but the authors make a compelling case that our current metrics simply are not working for this setting. In some sense, the results are not surprising: of course the learned metric does better in the evaluation setting that it was trained in. But, the fact that it also does well in a unimodal setting suggests that the model has not overfit to particular spurious factors in the corpus, which is promising. Overall --- I think the authors make a convincing case for their model-based metric. And, the fine-grained evaluations in table 5 provide some perspective on where the metric could be improved, e.g., accounting more for grammatically and irrelevant nouns. ",
    "weaknesses": "Of course, training on human judgments directly is not a panacea. There's always the concern that whichever pairwise comparisons were originally collected won't generalize to future corpora, e.g., if the models improve in the future, will the particular model generations that Vrank was trained on become \"stale\"? \nThat being said, because the current evaluation metrics are essentially performing at random for the story generation setting, even a stale Vrank couldn't possibly be worse.\nThe author's contribution is in visual story generation evaluation; the task itself is somewhat niche, and so, while I think folks who evaluate on this dataset/setup should use this dataset, I suspect that the work's works impact will mostly be focused on that specific community.\nOne small technical concern: For Table 4, The BLEU-4 score is suspiciously low, especially in comparison to SacreBLEU, which also computes BLEU-4. My suspicion is that BLEU-4 is often zero for some stories, which leads to many ties of 0 vs 0. I think that ties should be broken randomly, or that the authors should mention this is the cause (if indeed my suspicions are correct). ",

It proposes to use a probe they name SpellingBee: a generative character-based LM that takes as input an uncontextualized word embedding from a model, and tries to predict the correct character sequence. It is trained on part of the model's vocabulary, and tested on the other: if it manages to succesfully generalize, the embedding must contain orthographic information. The probe is tested on 4 models: Roberta-base, and 3 others showing change in a particular aspect: Roberta-large for size, AraBert for language, and GPT2-Medium for an autoregressive model. The probe's capacity to predict the character sequence is evaluated by counting the exact matches, and with a finer-grained metric measuring overlap. Compared to a control experiment where the probe is not trained and only randomly initialized, the probe is able to better rebuild character sequences when fed with embeddings from the LMs (up to 30-40% from 0 for exact matches); however, it's performance is weakened when the training part of the vocabulary is filtered (removing token too similar to those in the testing part, or with the same lemma). However, using a probe trained on the full vocabulary as a way to initialize a LM does not seem to be useful, as the LM reaches the same training loss as a control one rather quickly. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper addresses the question of whether the spelling of words has been retained / encoded by large language models. First, it introduces a probe to discover the spelling of a word based on the embeddings in the model input. This probe, spelling bee, is essentially a character level language model which is conditioned on the word embedding. They find that a significant amount of information about spelling is retained by the embedding, and that explicitly providing information about spelling during training by using spelling bee does not provide additional advantage to the model. The authors conclude that this indicates language models “can quickly acquire all the character level information they need without directly observing the composition of each token”. ",

As is, it's not clear what a true upper-bound performance would be for such a probe.\n I felt that the conclusions drawn from the attempt to train with additional spelling information were not well justified. After all, if training with the additional information actually damaged performance, the authors would not have concluded that the model doesn’t use the information or that the information was somehow harmful or misleading. Instead, they would rightly assume that the particular procedure they were using to add that information was not providing it in a structure that the model could easily use. However, because it doesn’t change  performance at all, the authors conclude that the model is able to acquire everything it needs without direct observation of the spelling. It’s not clear to me that these results contradict the idea that some information about character composition might be able to help a model.\nThere needs to be more detail on the implementation of spelling bee.

A serious issue! for example over 56% of Ro-En sentences are discarded.\nFor sentence-level QE they use a SOTA method called TransQuest (using XLM-R base). \nThey experiment with the MTQE-PE data set that has both Direct Assessment (DA) with a scale of 0-100 of MT sentences by humans and Post Editing of these sentences. \nThey only keep sentences with DA score below 70 for the DA task.\nThe major results per the authors are in Table 2. It shows that 3 language pairs that some of the semi-supervised methods outperform the glass-box supervised approach (though it is worse uniformly and significantly than the black box Micro TransQuest approach.)\nThe authors do not provide significance tests or standard deviations of the metrics making it hard to judge if these results are meaningful for discriminating between the approaches.

The fact that the 4 metrics cannot handle perfectly correct MT output or 100% error full MT output is a major weakness particularly for the proposed type of use case which is identifying where the errors are in the MT system output. I recommend the authors define metrics that enable evaluation on the whole test set.  For example one can use an F-measure like metric on all the words in the test set. It can be done either by using a threshold to define an error detection and then measuring Precision and recall of all error events (words) a micro-F or if no threshold is desired for every word a mean square error is measured between system probability of an error and the gold truth (again a micro measure over all word positions) for all sentences in the test set). \n  2. By selecting higher error rate sentences, metrics like accuracy at 1 are measuring more of the tail of the distribution since one is counting if the top scoring event is indeed an error ( a sentence has many errors typically).\n3. Also, given that all 4 metrics are averaged over the test instances, at least a standard deviation should be given to give a sense of the variability of the 4 metrics for a test condition.\n4.

    "paper_summary": "This paper presents a semi-supervised method for word-level quality estimation by using sentence level QE models which are mapped to word-level QE using feature attribution (rationale extraction) methods. The core hypothesis is that sentence level quality stems from word level translation errors, thus sentence level models should store information about which individual tokens are likely to be correct/incorrect, and this information can be surfaced by feature attribution methods. This work follows recent research directions in model probing and “bertology”, applying feature attribution methods to QE.  The authors test several methods of feature attribution – empirical results show that feature attribution models trained on sentence-level data outperform a random baseline, but are significantly worse than supervised models trained on word-level QE training data, which is generated by automatically aligning tokens in MT hypotheses with their corresponding human post-edits. ",
    "strengths": "The idea of probing sentence-level models for word-level information is compelling -- the word- and sentence-level QE tasks are well-suited to testing feature attribution methods because standard training and evaluation datasets from the many iterations of the WMT QE shared tasks should allow for straightforward comparison with and leveraging of existing approaches, and the tasks are already divided into different levels of granularity.

( the notion of an \"attribution budget\" could be useful here) - do feature attribution approaches completely miss some types of word-level errors? does this show that sentence level models aren't learning that information? or does it indicate a problem with the data generation method of the word-level QE task?

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes to extract word-level quality information for machine translated text from a state-of-the-art sentence-level quality estimation (QE) model, based on pre-trained contextual embeddings, fine-tuned in a semi-supervised way, i.e. using only sentence-level scores for fine-tuning. The main research question the authors focus on is, do QE models infer sentence-level translation quality scores based on word-level errors, which would provide insights on the model decision making (rationales) and alleviate the need of costly error-annotated word-level data. \n  To answer this question, an empirical work is conducted by comparing several interpretability related approaches, so-called feature attribution methods, as well as a supervised and an unsupervised approach, along with a random classification baseline. Experiments include three translation directions towards English and are performed on a publicly available dataset. Results show the superiority of two approaches, namely integrated gradients and attention weights, based on several metrics calculated on a test corpus where sentences containing only or no errors were ignored.\nThe analysis of these results is rather succinct, but proposes nonetheless a few interesting observation nuggets. First, more useful error-related word-level information is encoded at deeper layers of the model, second, both source and target sentences appear to have an impact on feature attribution, third, frequency of words in the machine translation training corpus and sentence-level QE seem to be in a relation of some sort. ",
    "strengths": "Overall, this paper is very well written, with a clear hypothesis and straightforward experimental setup.  The semi-supervised word-level translation errors extraction paradigm is, to the best of my knowledge, relatively novel when using contextual embedding models. The approach proposed by the authors is thus interesting for the research community and could pave the way towards more cost effective translation QE, fine-grained methods for explaining QE models outputs, etc.\nWhile the experimental results do not necessarily emphasize which approach would allow for the best word-level QE results, which is not the scope of the study, they offer a comparison point for future work and validate the use of semi-supervised methods for word-level QE. The analysis provides a few insights on where the information is encoded in the model, as well as the importance of source and target sentences for QE modelling.\nThe use of publicly available resources, including the dataset and the various implementations, ensure a reasonable level of reproducibility. ",
    "weaknesses": "The main weaknesses of this paper are the empirical validation of the method proposed by the authors and the lack of deep analysis. The main findings are limited to applying to QE a set of existing interpretability oriented methods already applied generally to NLP tasks.  For the empirical validation of the method, the evaluation does not reflect a general scenario in machine translation where both perfect and fully erroneous translations exist. Additionally, as shown later in the analysis, there could be a relation between word frequency distributions in the machine translation training data and the ability of the QE model to rely on this information to estimate the sentence-level translation quality. This phenomenon should be investigated further, for instance by replacing the random baseline by a frequency based classifier, as a starting point. The various approaches used as feature attribution methods, along with the current experimental setup, do not offer a clear understanding of what the QE model does unfortunately.\nFor the analysis section, extracting a useful QE signal at deeper layers of the pre-trained model is somewhat expected, but is still interesting to find. However, we need more insights on what kind of information is encoded at each layer, by the use of probes for instance, at a sentence-level basis. As Figures 2 and 3 indicate, variability in feature attribution between layers show that some words, in some context (sentences in this case), receive different scores given an approach. What are the characteristics of these words and sentences? Do feature attribution methods agree or diverge given words in context? ",
    "comments": "It would be interesting to see how relevant to word-level QE is the information encoded at different layers of the model without fine-tuning for sentence-level QE, by using simple classifiers as probes for instance. \n  The feature attribution method based on attention could easily be the focus of the study, whether by using the method proposed by (Kobayashi et al., 2020, “Attention is Not Only a Weight:Analyzing Transformers with Vector Norms”) as a comparison point, by analysing attention heads separately the same way it is conducted per layer, etc. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes HASHEE, a very simple Hash-based Early Exiting approach. Traditional early exiting methods focus on predicting instance difficulty by heuristic metrics or learnable modules so that easier instances can be assigned to lower layers to exit while more difficult instances can go through more layers. However, the preliminary experiments in this paper show that both human-defined and model-defined instance difficulty is hard to learn. The more important issue in early exiting is to keep the consistency between training and inference, i.e., let similar training instances and inference instances exit from the same layer. To this end, the authors propose to replace the learn-to-exit modules with hash functions to assign each token to a fixed exiting layer. This method requires no internal classifiers and can perform token-level early exiting without supervision. The method achieves higher performance with fewer FLOPs compared with strong baselines on classification, regression, and generation tasks, showing its superiority. ",
    "strengths": "__1. The paper is well organized and easy to follow. The proposed method is well illustrated.__\n__2. The proposed method is novel and interesting__ The proposed hash-based early exiting approach removes the learning process and only sticks to the consistency between training and inference, which is novel and interesting.  The authors introduce four kinds of hash functions based on different intuition and find that the frequency hash outperforms other has functions as well as other baselines by a large margin, which is surprising.  __3. The experimental results are impressive__ The improvement brought by HASHEE is very significant and surpasses many strong baselines. Besides, HASHEE can be used in various kinds of tasks including classification, regression, and generation tasks, showing great practicability and universality. ",
    "weaknesses": "__1. The relation between instance difficulty and training-inference consistency remains vague:__      This paper seems to try to decouple the concept of instance difficulty and training-inference consistency in current early exiting works. However, I don't think these two things are orthogonal and can be directly decoupled.  Intuitively, according to the accuracy of the prediction, there are two main situations for training-inference inconsistency: the inconsistent exit makes the prediction during inference better than that during training, and vice versa. The first case is unlikely to occur. For the second case, considering instance difficulty reflects the decline in the prediction accuracy of the instances during training and inference, it may be regarded as the second case of training-inference consistency. Accordingly, I am still a little bit confused about the relation between instance difficulty and training-inference consistency after reading the paper.  I would suggest that the authors calculate the token-level difficulty of the model before and after using the hash function, and perform more analysis on this basis. In fact, if the hash function is instance-level, the sentence-level difficulty of all baselines (including static and dynamic models) can be calculated, which will provide a more comprehensive and fair comparison. \n     __2. Lack of the analysis of the relation between instance-level consistency and token-level consistency:__ The core idea derived from the preliminary experiments is to enhance the instance-level consistency between training and inference, i.e., mapping semantically similar instances into the same exiting layer. However, the practical method introduces the consistency constrain at the token level. The paper doesn’t show that whether the token-level method can truely address or mitigate the inconsistency problem at the instance level.  I would suggest the authors define metrics to reflect the instance-level and token-level consistency, and conduct an experiment to verify that whether they are correlated. ",
    "comments": "1. I didn’t follow the description of the sentence-level hash function from Line 324 to Line 328: If we use the sequence encoder (e.g., Sentence-BERT) as a hash function to directly map the instances to the exiting layer, why do we still need an internal classifier at that layer? And considering all the instances can be hashed by the pre-trained sequence encoder in advance before training (and early exiting), the appearance of label imbalance should not cause any actual harm? Why does it become a problem?\n2. The paper addresses many times (Line 95-97, Line 308-310) that the consistency between training and inference can be easily satisfied due to the smoothness of neural models. I would suggest giving more explanations on this. ",

    "paper_summary": "This short paper presents an alternative to label smoothing for neural MT.  In one variant (\"weighted\"), the amount of training-time probability assigned to every vocab item except the correct one at each time step in the decoder is varied based on whether the item appears in the source-side vocabulary, target-side vocabulary, or both.  The more fully explored variant (\"masked\") just sets the source-side vocabulary weight to 0 and distributes the smoothed weight evenly over the vocabulary items in the other two classes.  Both variants of label smoothing are motivated by a noticed drop in BLEU scores whenever label smoothing is done with source/target vocabulary sharing also turned on.  Label smoothing and vocabulary sharing each improve scores over the Transformer-base, but using the two together hurts performance.\nMasked label smoothing (with vocab sharing) is tested against Transformer-base, vocab sharing alone, label smoothing alone, and vocab sharing + label smoothing together.  Evaluation is mainly by BLEU score on a variety of data sets (IWSLT, WMT, CASIA) and language pairs.  The score differences are not large -- I think never more than 0.5 BLEU) -- but the authors report that using masked label smoothing statistically outperforms regular label smoothing when vocab selection is also turned on.\nThe short paper fits in four pages as required.  There is a one-page appendix.  There's also a small software package with a README as part of the uploaded submission -- but it's not mentioned in the text and so I almost missed it. ",
    "strengths": "- Focused, straightforward idea with a clear intuitive and practical motivation.  I think people will be interested in this paper's observations and proposed solution.  I expect that the details necessary for re-implementation are relatively clear.\n- Evaluation on several different language pairs, which includes some diversity of character set / writing system.  Both into and out of English is covered. ",
    "weaknesses": "- The use of the appendix is a little more integral than I think would be ideal.  You have to read the appendix in order to know the conclusions of some analysis; the main text only says that such-and-such \"matters,\" but now how.\n- It's not always clear which results are meaningful.  Some rows of the main table have statistical significance tests, but other metrics, analysis, and data points do not.  Since the score differences are overall quite small, this detracts from the reliability of the results.  Readers might be inclined to decide that the techniques aren't worth trying. ",
    "comments": "SUGGESTIONS - It's great to have at least some statistical significance tests.  Since they were added only after the first revision of the paper, I felt like they weren't fully integrated into the main text or all of the results tables (like Table 5).  For example, the beginning of Section 5.2 (line 201) says that LS \"outperforms\" VS+LS... but we do not have any significance tests between these two configurations.  These differences of 0.1 BLEU may actually be ties, in which case \"outperforms\" is incorrect.\n- In Table 3(b), is it really the case that 23.19 BLEU for RO-EN is statistically better than 23.15, or is this a typo?  I've never seen significance at p < 0.01 for such a tiny score change.\n- Even without a formal significance test, can we have some intuition about this ECE score in Section 6.1 / Table 4?  How is this score computed and what properties of MT training does it reflect?  I've never heard of this metric before, so I don't really understand what it is or whether an improvement of 0.7 is meaningful.  (Whereas I know quite well how much intuitive importance to give 0.7 BLEU.)\n- In Table 5, I would think that one intuitive configuration is to devalue the source vocabulary without shutting it off completely, via parameter settings like 0.5-0.5-0.25.  If your original motivation is correct, I would expect a configuration like that to do better than your current best result, 0.5-0-0.5.  Doesn't the current result indicate that the source-side vocabulary is somehow quite helpful -- the opposite of your initial claim?\nOTHER TYPOS OR CONFUSION - Why don't the numbers at the top of Table 5 (for baseline label smoothing) match the scores given in Table 3 for LS?  Aren't these identical configurations?\n- How do you decide when model training is over?  Is it a fixed number of epochs or updates, or after perplexity on the dev set converges (for some definition), etc.  Appendix B doesn't say.  Since your experiments modify the kind of signal that the model receives during training, I was wondering if that has a confounding effect on the results.  (For example, if MLS makes the training last 25 percent more updates than the baseline, then is the increased performance partially due to the mere fact of training longer?)\n- The WLS parameters \"1-1-0\" in Section 4.2 (line 175) directly contradict the claim in Section 4.1 (line 150) that these three values must sum to 1.

    "paper_summary": "The paper argues that jointly adopting both label smoothing and vocabulary sharing techniques can be conflicting. This comes from a simple intuition that words have zero overlap with the possible target words should have no chance to appear in the target sentence. They propose to use a very simple approach (Masked label smoothing) that addresses the conflict. Results show that the method gains very incremental improvement in translation accuracy and some improvement in model calibration.  Overall the conflict is interesting but the result is very mixed.

In other cases (e.g. in the specific case (EN-RO - Table 5)), the improvement is +0.04 (from 23.15 to 23.19), which I would say it does not imply anything that is particularly meaningful.  able 5 also shows that assigning B_s to 0 seems does not matter that much (i.e. it does not hurt the performance that much).

    "paper_summary": "This paper is an extension of the SUPERB benchmark for assessing pre-trained upstream speech models acquired through Self-supervised learning. The authors argue that SUPERB is limited to 10 tasks and that 5 new tasks, here AST, Out-of-Domain ASR, Voice Conversion, Speech separation and Speech enhancement would permit to better evaluate the semantic and generative capability of such SSL models. The authors compare the same SSL models used in the SUPERB paper on the 5 tasks. All SSL models were used as-is without fine-tuning on the task (frozen). Overall results show some superiority of Wav2vec and Hubert models on AST and OOD ASR tasks, while VC SE and SS tasks lead to less obvious superiority of models. The authors then performed experiments with varying data training for some SSL models or downstream tasks and showed that the ranking of ssl models stay consistent which should prove the robustness of these new evaluation tasks. ",
    "strengths": "- Setting up benchmarks is highly important to assess SSL speech models - The proposed tasks provide a complementary view to the 10 already existing task of SUPERB  - The authors have shown that the proposed tasks leads to consistent results according to the upstream and downstream training data - Although the authors did not trained the SSL models, this stay an impressive and useful amount of work, that according to what I understood from the text, should be made available to the community (when?) ",
    "weaknesses": "- If the 5 new tasks are indeed assessing different properties than the 10 superb tasks do, they are not all well justified. AST is tested on only one couple of language (EN->De) while OODASR on 3 (+spontaneous). Regarding SE and SS, given that SSL models are trained only on clean read speech it is not properly justified why such tasks are relevant.  - The 5 tasks are indeed an interesting addition to SUPERB but : AST is not new since it has already been used in SSL benchmarks (cf. LeBenchmark). A more realistic OODASR would arguably be out-of-domain data (cf. Hsu et al 2021)  rather than out of language data for which XLSR and XLS-R are far more adequate. Finally, the SE and SS tasks are difficult to justify and probably far less relevant for an ACL venue than more speech oriented events.   - Such contribution is really useful to assess to which extent models can improve downstream tasks but it does not reveal why they do it. At the end we don't learn much about the models.  - Finally, it is rare that models are used without fine-tuning so it is unclear why such fine-tuning was not considered in the study (adaptability is not an interesting feature?)

For this, a general-domain student model is trained to mimic the neuron activation patterns of a calibrated domain-specific teacher model.

It would be especially important to report results on NER datasets as this is a standard benchmark for biomedical PLMs.    - The second concern is whether the reported experiments actually allow to conclude that the proposed method actually works as intended. Couldn't there be other reasons for the reported improvements of the domain-adapted models over the finetuned ones (-ft vs DoKTra in Table 2)? For instance, it would seem important to compare to using a general-domain teacher to make sure the improvements are actually due to transferred domain knowledge and not because of other factors related to distillation. Relatedly, what would happen when using an ALBERT-sized BERT model as student? This would be important to confirm that the improvements are actually because architectural improvements of the student were utilized. Also, it is mentioned that the student model is also finetuned with a calibration regularizer. It would be important to include ALEBRT-ft + calibration regularizer in the ablation study to make sure that the observed improvements do not stem from the calibration regularizer.\nAdditionally, I have also one minor comment. A comparison to domain-specific PLMs adapted with continued pretraining would be informative, as it would allow researchers to determine how much performance could be gained if they invested the resources to do that. For this, e.g. the RoBERTa model of [1] could be used.

It may be unfair. \n(2)\tWhy the Baseline outperforms Yu et al. (2020) on ACE 04 and ACE 05 greatly, but has comparable performance on OntoNotes 5 and CoNLL 2003? Yu et al. (2020) also conducted experiments on the GENIA dataset, but the paper doesn’t report the results on this dataset. \n(3)\tAccording to the Table 4, the improvement of BS against LS is marginal.  Some statements are not very accurate. For example, Line 313, the submission says “this work is among the first to introduce a span-based approach to Chinese NER tasks and establish SOTA results.”, however, Shen et al. 2021 proposed a span-based approach previously, and conducted the NER experiment on Chinese Weibo dataset.

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes a smoothing regularization technique for NER. The technique proposed targets boundary smoothing where the authors claim that inconsistent boundaries are often seen as a problem in annotated NLP NER datasets. The results after applying the method shows less over-confidence, better model calibration, flatter neural minima and more smoothed loss landscapes which plausibly explain performance improvement rather than directly/only addressing the inconsistent boundary span labeling problem in NER. The result attributes are empirically verified. ",
    "strengths": "1. After 95% performance ranges, bringing improvements to any problem systematically is certainly a challenging dilemma. In this regard, the work proposed in this paper is already notable.\n2. The problem of inconsistent span annotations identified in this paper indeed can also be intuited as an NLP annotation problem hence is a valid one that needs to be addressed. The solution to regularize this problem with smoothing technique for span-based NER method is sound and well justified throughout the paper. The reader would benefit from reading the theory and methods in this paper.\n3. The code is publicly released.\n4. The empirical analysis is well performed. I especially appreciate section 5.2 which directly tries to shed light on the question that formed the problem premise of this work and I quote \"How does boundary smoothing improve the model performance?\" It offers a slight indication of a negative result as in not being able to quantitatively verify it owing to irregularities in distribution between synthesized boundary noise and actual noise in the datasets. Nevertheless, it shows another promising result with smoothed loss landscapes indicating sound machine learning settings.\n5. The fact that boundary smoothing addresses the over-confidence issue of target span predictions is quite meaningful, hence again a plus for this paper. ",
    "weaknesses": "Not quite a weakness of this work, just a question I am wondering about. Considering that the boundary smoothing regularization distributes itself around the entity span, is it that the actual problem of whether such a function addresses the boundary irregularity problem in the NLP datasets can never be verified? It is indeed understood from the method explanation in the paper that it can to some extent. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper addresses the problem of how to weight task-specific losses in multi-task learning and presents an algorithm to adapt weights of loss functions, each of which corresponds to a task, during training.\nThe key idea is to update loss weights so that the weighted sum of task-specific gradients moves model parameters to the direction which reduces all task-specific losses computed on held-out data.\nThe proposed algorithm is expected to (a) avoid undesirable task performance trade-offs (i.e, sacrificing performance on one task to improve on another task) and (b) facilitate better generalization.\nThe experiments showed that the proposed method achieved meaningful improvements in most of the tested individual tasks, and also achieved significantly higher performances on average. ",
    "strengths": "1. The proposed method directly and naturally addresses the trade-off problem of multi-task learning. The design motivation is easy to understand thus can facilitate  further, deeper research easily.\n2. The presented experiments clearly demonstrated the performance superiority in two different types of text classification tasks. Thus it is arguable that the proposed method will have broader applications. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The experimental settings may be in favor of the proposed method and the actual performance gap in the averaged loss may not be as significant as presented in the paper. The loss function of the “Uniform” baseline uses a constant weight across tasks, which matches the weights used in the evaluation of average performance. Thus I expect that the baseline’s performance is not very much behind the other methods including the proposed method *for the averaged score*. However Figure 2 and 3 shows it performed poorly. This may suggest that the baseline, and other baselines,  might overfit to the training data. There is no mention of the criteria to stop training so I cannot tell whether the authors did early stopping using held-out data. Since the proposed method uses a held-out dataset (called “query” in the paper) to control training, I think it is fair to use such a dataset to control training of baseline methods.\n2. The paper doesn’t provide insights about the adapted weights except they looked to keep adapted during training. I think it is of general interest whether the proposed method actually controlled task weights nicely and/or the other baseline methods assigned task weights poorly and resulted in worse performances and due to that. The scaling of Figure 8 and 9 makes it hard to compare weights between compared methods, especially MGDA and GradNorm, because these absolute values are much smaller than others and see *relative magnitudes” between tasks. ( For task weighting, absolute magnitudes don’t matter.) I think the paper doesn’t provide strong evidence that the observed good performances were actually due to better task weighting.\n3. Related to #2, no reason is provided to support why the baselines were chosen to compare. The readers who follow the technical area closely might understand how informative contrasting the proposed method and the baselines are, but for others like me, they look like random choices. Explanations are required to describe why they were chosen. ",
    "comments": "1. The theoretical analysis doesn’t provide much insight beyond that a loss computed on a held-out dataset (= the query set) is a better estimator of the expected loss than that computed on the training data, which is well known. It could be fully removed to make spaces for other discussions.\n2. Scatter plots in Figure 2 and 3 are not very suitable because it is hard to see how each run is distributed when they overlap. Box plots like in Figure 4 and 5 would be better. ",

The authors analyze a known dataset for the existence of this particular bias for 7 language directions and show that there is bias for two of them (en-de and en-zh). Consequently, they proposed 4 modifications of the successful monoTransQuest model, in which the QE model is jointly trained with another task: a bilingual QE, a QE augmented with binary classification of correct vs. artificial false translations, an adversarial task of not being based on target fluency and the debiased focal loss. Finally, they perform experiments of all these modifications against the baseline, and they show that the system augmented with the binary classifier gives the better tradeoff of bias reduction and increasing QE performance.

Due to this bias, the methods tend to only consider the features associated with the generated translations (and not the source sentences) for assessing the overall quality. The authors attribute the cause of this bias to both the model and the human annotators as they tend of provide a high score to fluent but inadequate translations.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to analyze the partial input bias problem and explore different approaches using auxiliary tasks for mitigating this bias. The proposed methods are designed by keeping in mind that they should aid in reducing the bias, be comparable or superior to the original performance and not lead to extensive computational overhead.

The proposed approach is compared against other modeling paradigms used in the ARA literature, namely classification and regression across 3 languages (English, French and Spanish).

The paper also releases a new parallel bilingual ARA dataset for future research. ",

    "comments": "1. Line 360-367 are occupying too much space than needed.  2. It was not clear to me that Vikidia is the new dataset that was introduced by the paper until I read the last section :)   3. Too many metrics used for evaluation. While I commend the paper’s thoroughness by using different metrics for evaluation, I believe in this case the multiple metrics create more confusion than clarity in understanding the results. I recommend using the strictest metric (such as RA) because it will clearly highlight the differences in performance. Also consider marking the best results in each column/row using boldface text.  4. I suspect that other evaluation metrics NDCG, SRRR, KTCC are unable to resolve the differences between NPRM and the baselines in some cases. For e.g., Based on the extremely large values (>0.99) for all approaches in Table 4, I doubt the difference between NPRM’s 0.995 and Glove+SVMRank 0.992 for Avg. SRR on NewsEla-EN is statistically significant.  5. I did not understand the utility of presenting results in Table 2 and Table 3. Why not simplify the presentation by selecting the best regression based and classification based approaches for each evaluation dataset and compare them against NPRM in Table 4 itself?  6. From my understanding, RA is the strictest evaluation metric, and NPRM performs worse on RA when compared to the baselines (Table 4) where simpler approaches fare better.  7. I appreciate the paper foreseeing the limitations of the proposed NPRM approach. However, I find the discussion of the first limitation somewhat incomplete and ending abruptly. The last sentence has the tone of “despite the weaknesses, NPRM is useful'' but it does not flesh out why it’s useful.  8. I found ln616-632 excessively detailed for a conclusion paragraph. Maybe simply state that better metrics are needed for ARA evaluation? Such detailed discussion is better suited for Sec 4.4 9. Why was a classification based model not used for the zero shot experiments in Table 5 and Table 6? These results in my opinion are the strongest aspect of the paper, and should be as thorough as the rest of the results.  10. Line 559: “lower performance on Vikidia-Fr compared to Newsela-Es …” – Why? These are different languages after all, so isn’t the performance difference in-comparable? ",

Modeling sound change computationally is a rarely seen task in the NLP venues, which is sad, since it is extremely important for general historical linguistics. \nThe paper under review proposes a smart method to trace gradual phonological replacements like lenition (t -> d, k -> g, etc). It will be of great use both to linguists and to NLP practitioners interested in change detection. In fact, the paper extends the computational change detection field from only semantics to phonology. ",
    "weaknesses": "1) Although the proposed method is indeed interesting, the  authors do not make any attempt to compare it to any other prior methods. They limit themselves to showing that the method produces statistically significant linear regressions. But this is, to my mind, insufficient as empirical evaluation. Why not implement a simple baseline (for example, character frequencies, etc) and compare to it? This would make the paper more persuasive.\n2) The strange results for \"p --> b\" sound change deserves more explanations beyond just noting that this is a rarer phoneme than the others. If the method is not able to trace sound change in 1/3 cases, it must be shown that it is still better than anything else (baselines).\n3) The method is entirely based on written signal (spelling). It is understandable that we lack proper phonological datasets, but I would like to see more discussion on how this spelling proxy might influence the performance of the proposed method. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper use methods relying on spelling, using character embeddings, to detect sound change across time. They rely on three datasets to test the effectiveness of their methods: a synthetic one in a language having a simplified phonotactic system, one in Danish with synthetically generated sound change, and a real one in Danish, with known sound change. They show that they can successfully detect the selected sound changes in the datasets, and identify precisely the context of the change. ",

The related works section is particularly well-written, with the right level of detail, even though some references are missing. \nThe experimental setup is sound and clear; in particular, the use of a control dataset is appreciated. ",
    "weaknesses": "1) The main issue in this paper is that you only show that you can successfully detect known sound changes, and that you don’t spuriously detect them when they’re absent, thanks to the control corpus. But you might detect a lot of changes in characters embeddings using your methods, that are not related to sound change. Using your system in an exploratory fashion, to detect all possible changes and categorize them, would greatly strengthen the paper. As it is, to my understanding, there is no way to be sure that the character embeddings do not lead to detecting a lot of changes independent from phonology, and this is a major issue. Moreover, the link between spelling and sound change is not straightforward to me and should be more clearly justified.\n2) Semantic and phonological change across time should indeed take a logistic shape, as you describe in your description; your experiments also seem to show that the change in the Geo corpus is not linear. Why did you stick to a linear shape? Shoemark et al (2019) that you cite also tried a logarithmic shape, you could try it too.\n3) There is a large amount of work on semantic change using contextualized embeddings and pre-trained language models, that you do not evoke in your related works (from Mario Giulianelli, Matej Martinc…).  4) The formalism you use, a --> b / c, should be introduced more clearly from the beginning. Especially since you use it as early as in the summary, where it can’t be comprehended without prior knowledge of this formalism. The explanation at line 190 might benefit from a scheme.

The work focuses on the quality of speech synthesis models when less than 5 hours or speech are available to train the model. It compares different architectures on two endangered languages (for one of them, the training set is built by the authors), showing that FastSpeech is less data-hungry than Tacotron, hence supporting its adoption in these cases. Finally, it validates that the resulting systems produce utterances of acceptable quality via human judgment. ",

It would be interesting to understand the effect of having multiple-speaker training sets. With this respect, I am not sure why \"it was deemed inappropriate to use the voices of speakers who passed away\". Although the right to be forgotten supports this approach, these speakers donated their voices to save endangered languages: as such, not exploiting these data seems to go against their own goal when they donated the utterances. However, it is a delicate topic, so the approach adopted by the paper is reasonable. Less motivated, instead, in my opinion, is the choice of removing \"utterances containing non Kanien'kéha characters\": proper names in different languages may also occur in real use cases.\nFinally, the work has no mention that the produced data and code will be released. In addition, the outputs are evaluated only with manual analysis. As a result, this work will be hard to reproduce. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper looks at ensembles of Large Transformers tagger models for Grammatical Error Correction. The authors discovered an ensemble that achieves a strong new SOTA of 76.05 on BEA-2019 test without pretraining on synthetic data. The authors additionally report model distillation results on synthetic data, where a single model achieves near SOTA with 73.21 on the BEA-2019 test. The single model is additionally not SOTA only in comparison to a much larger T5 model.\nThe models utilized in this paper are based on the well known GECToR system. Performance improvements are obtained by: (1) upgrading model size to Large (GECToR used Base), (2) changing tokenizer (GECToR changed tokenizer from the one used during pretraining), (3) filtering of edit free sentences, (4) increasing vocabulary size (the vocabulary of possible edits), (5) ensembling by majority vote on edit spans instead of ensembling on average output tag probabilities, (6) distillation. Two new synthetic datasets are constructed for distillation: one from the One Billion Word Benchmark and one from the The Blog Authorship Corpus.\nTraining is performed in three stages: (1) optionally train on synthetic data, (2) finetune on the edits of Lang-8, NUCLE, FCE, W&I in this order, (3) finetune on W&I only. At inference the paper uses a tweak from GECToR, adjusting the keep probability by a tuned amount. Ensembling is performed over RoBERTa, DeBERTa and XLNet with different model sizes and edit vocabulary sizes. ",

Below is a list of minor points, and they can be fixed rather easily.\n- The paper does not defend itself well enough.

The description in section 3 is not detailed enough.\n- The paragraph and the table right above section 4.1 are good to have, but they feel cherry-picked. The paper should consider discussing other benefits, such as how easy it is to add new words to the model.\n- Section 4.1 is weak, if not hurting the paper.

The approach would not be effective if we apply it to Japanese Kanji or Mandarin Chinese. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper concerns the task of temporal grounding, which is framed as the mapping of temporal expressions (morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night) to their start and end time hours in the day in different languages (and cultures). To achieve such a mapping,  different approaches are proposed: a) a corpus-based approach where start and end time are (indirectly) inferred from the distribution of time references in Wikipedia data; b) two language-model (LM) methods where start and time can be either i) directly predicted by multilingual BERT, or ii) indirectly estimated from the predictions of multilingual BERT. Such methods are evaluated against newly created gold standard temporal annotations for 4 languages (Italian, Hindi, English and Portuguese). Additionally, the most successful extractive corpus-based method is tested on other  (although unlabeled) 24 languages. The paper also includes several discussions on cultural/temporal differences across languages and additional analyses on the proposed methods. ",
    "strengths": "The paper contributes to a niche of research by proposing an interesting take on the study of time expressions in NLP.  Specifically, the cross-lingual and cross-cultural focus of this paper provides several insights on the challenges of temporal commonsense that can inform research on the topic by highlighting -- often neglected in NLP -- language variability and speakers (time) experiences. This, in particular, emerges in sections 2.3, 5.2, 5.3 but also in 7.   Besides being reported as a quite informative process (section 2), the creation and consequent release of temporal gold standard annotations for 4 different languages can be a useful resource for the community.  The paper is reasonably well-written and pleasant to read. ",
    "weaknesses": "(1) It is claimed that this paper “propose a task”, “reframe a research question”. It thus seems to suggest that this work addresses temporal grounding as a *new* task. However, information about its utility and scenarios of applicability is not really elaborated (just a generic sentence at l.60) and are rather left to the reader to imagine. Also, the related work is presented as more of a description of previous studies rather than a critical “mapping”. As a consequence, it is hard to situate the proposed methods and insights and how they differ from/ and contribute to the topic. I would suggest being more specific and explicit about its contributions and how it relates to previous work.  (2) I see some issues with the proposed methods and evaluation: 2a) Figure 2 shows how different annotators (for the same language) referred to different time ranges for the same part of the day. In fact, Hindi annotations suggest that night can span till 9 am, thus overlapping with the time range for the morning, too. Then, at lines 195-99, the extractive approach is defined as to infer *non-overlapping* time ranges. Finally, in Figure 3, the gold standard annotations are represented as non-overlapping time spans among parts of the day. It is however unmentioned how a clear-cut distinction across parts of the day with definite time spans was defined to create such a final benchmark.  2b) Section 3.1: the extractive corpus-based approach relies on *English* Wikipedia data. No information about the number of time expressions needed is however provided. Also, I wonder whether by relying on English time expressions -- which are then automatically translated into other languages -- a strong western bias is induced as well as translation errors: was there someone with the needed language competence to verify the soundness of such translations? This part should be better documented, for instance in the supplementary material. \n  2c) The translation error issue presents itself also in section 3.2. Footnote number 5 mentions that BERT queries are based on the template “The <morning> starts at <9.00>\", and that such sentences are automatically translated into other languages. In a language with grammatical gender such as Italian, however, the translation of “the” would vary depending on the mentioned part of the day (e.g. the afternoon: IL pomeriggio; the morning: LA mattina). Is this something that has been adapted? If not could it have skewed BERT predictions?\n2d) In section 4.2. the proposed approaches are compared against a baseline based on the “greeting method” by Vilares and Gόmez-Rόdriguez (2018). Their work however does not really seem to serve well as a baseline since it does not entail a *method*. Rather, they created a corpus to conduct an analysis on the semantics of greetings. Thus their goal is different from the one pursued in this paper, and their corpus here is simply employed to test the extractive method (3.1) on a different source of data.  (3) Although the paper is reasonably well written and pleasant to read, some turns are taken for granted and not really justified. For instance, the analysis in section 5 seems to concern the 24 unlabeled languages, this is however left unstated. Also, for instance, in 5.1 the analysis is carried out for Italian only, but the choice for such a decision is not given. ",
    "comments": "As a general comment, I find that this paper seems to be a bit scattered, or better, it alternatively shifts from a culturally-situated focus to the strive for “language-agnostic” approaches. Besides the fact that I am having some doubt as to whether such approaches grant the definition of language-independent method (it does not seem to be very effective on all languages, it largely relies on *English* data and concepts, e.g. noon), I think that such shifts bring the paper out of focus at times and may affect its narrative. Note that this is more  more of an opinionated point of view (which could be discarded and I am thus not putting in the weaknesses section), but I think the paper should enhance the former, linguistically and culturally grounded perspective, which in my opinion is also the main strength of this work.  Few minor suggestions: - footnote1. move it at line 58 - footnote2: specify HIT acronym - the related work would be maybe put to better use after the introduction Finally, as per https://2021.aclweb.org/ethics/Ethics-review-questions/, information about the compensation of annotators via Amazon Mechanical Turk has to be provided.

The pre-trained language models can thus serve knowledge base construction tasks such as link prediction (LP), (cross-lingual) entity linking (XEL), bilingual lexicon induction (BLI), and prompt-based knowledge probing (LM-KP).  For inference, the authors propose two types of inferences; one as autoregressive inference that makes the LM generate objects to complete KB tuplets using constrained beam search, and the other as similarity-based inference that generates similarity-comparable embeddings using a contrastive learning method (Mirror-BERT).  They evaluated the proposed approach on the aforementioned downstream tasks. For the LP task, they evaluated on the DBpedia and achieved the best performance on Hits@1 across all languages compared to baseline models (TransE, ComplEx, and RotatE). For the XEL task, they evaluated on the UMLS and outperformed baselines  (XLM-R and mBERT, both with contrastive learning) in most languages.

In most experiments, the paper only compares with the original XLM-R or mBERT trained without any knowledge base information. It is unclear whether such encoders being fine-tuned towards the KB tasks would actually perform comparable to the proposed approach. I would like to see experiments like just fine tuning the encoders with the same dataset but the MLM objective in their original pretraining and comparing with them. Such baselines can leverage on input sequences as simple as `<s>X_s X_p X_o </s>` where one of them is masked w.r.t. MLM training.\n- The design of input formats is intuitive and lacks justifications. Although the input formats for monolingual and cross-lingual links are designed to be consistent, it is hard to tell why the design would be chosen. As the major contribution of the paper, justifying the design choice matters. In other words, it would be better to see some comparisons over some variants, say something like `<s>[S]X_s[S][P]X_p[P][O]X_o[O]</s>` as wrapping tokens in the input sequence has been widely used in the community.

Given the training data sizes differ a lot, I would like to see an ablation that the model is trained on a mix of multilingual data with the same overall dataset size as the monolingual.

    "paper_summary": "This paper introduces a method to improve both interpretations and inference by training an end-to-end model to simultaneously generate explanations and labels for the NLI and CQA tasks. Compared to previous work which either produces explanations that are used to infer the label or vice-versa, this work introduces a framework that trains both tasks jointly. This is done by iteratively updating the predicted label at each explanation decoding step. The representations of the label and the explanation tokens are combined through gating mechanisms and used as input for the next timestep, enabling the model to use the explanation generated thus far to predict the label and the predicted label to guide the generation of the next explanation token. To improve the correlation between the inferred label and the generated interpretation, an additional adversarial regularization is used. Experiments show that this model shows improvements in both inference and interpretation compared to baselines. ",

    "weaknesses": "1. The Methodology section is very hard to follow. The model architecture description is rather confusing and sometimes uses inconsistent notation. For example, Section 2.2 introduces $v^p_{t-1}$ in the description which does not appear in the equations. Some of the notation pertaining to the labels ($l_0$, $l_{t-1}$) initially gives the impression that a sequence of tokens are being generated as the label, which is not the case. \n2. It is not clear why the baseline model considered for the NLI task is based on an older work (Conneau et al., 2017) and not the work by Kumar and Talukdar (2020), which seems more relevant to this work and is also cited in the paper. In addition, all the comparisons in the result section (and the delta numbers in Table 1) are made against a baseline vanilla Transformer model. \n3. Some of the numbers presented in Table 1 are confusing. It is not clear how a BLEU score of 22.51 is obtained by evaluating the ground truth dataset against itself for the NLI task. It is also not explained how the perplexity results are obtained. Are the numbers averaged across the dataset? Would that be a valid way to present these results? \n4. Some details like whether the results are averaged across multiple runs, and what the inter-annotator agreement was in the human evaluation are missing. ",

This paragraph would flow better if there were a sentence linking the two parts and making it explicit that the Transformer model is being used.

Presumably it is meant to be $L$, $E$ since no $R$ is introduced anywhere.\n- In Section 3.2, the description of the Transformer baseline states that an MLP layer is added for generating sentence-level interpretations. This was perhaps meant to be predicted labels and not the interpretations, unless the decoder here is generating the labels - this needs clarification or correction.\n- In the results under \"Interpretation Promotion\", it is stated that \"most of the explanations generated by our method are reasonable even though the BLEU scores are low\".

Specifically, the “mutual promotion” is done using stepwise integration mechanism (SIM; Section 2.2). Additionally, adversarial fidelity regularization is used to further “improve the fidelity of inference and interpretation” (Section 2.3).   Essentially, during training, the model generates explanation first, and at the last time-step, generates the prediction. Therefore, the explanation and prediction are using largely the same parameters, and gradient updates would influence both the explanation and prediction.\nThe authors experiment on NLI and conversational QA tasks.

The paper further proposes to compress the fine-tuned topmost layers into less layers to reduce model parameters.

Using MT-DNN would save memory, but the results are not satisfying. The authors thus propose an approach that saves memory and at the same time achieves good results on GLUE.\nFigure 1 gives a good summary. First, train task-specific models (but for each model, only finetune the top n layers). Second, do knowledge distillation, so that we can compress the n layers into a smaller number of layers. Third, merge all the models together as shown in Figure 1(c). The GLUE performance is comparable to full fine-tuning (i.e., tuning k models separately where k is the number of tasks), and the proposed approach saves 2/3 of memory. ",

There could be other ways of clustering the tasks.  - Adapter is a widely used framework that performs well for MTL. Although not directly connected to the authors' approach, I think that the authors should at least discuss it a bit more in the paper. Given the adaptor framework, would the authors’ approaches perform better? Are the authors’ approaches complementary?  Experimental details - Given that this is an empirical paper, I believe that much more detailed descriptions on hyperparameters (for example, on each task) are necessary.  More tasks - Relatively minor: Efficient BERT related papers recently often report SQuAD results as well, given that it’s a different format (span selection instead of multiple choice) and the skillset may be different from GLUE. Do authors think that their approach would adapt to SQuAD?  Motivation - Relatively minor: If there is a much larger number of tasks, the authors’ approach may not be as efficient as shown in table 2 (i.e., two thirds of memory), given that the authors’ approach is still O(k) where k is the number of task.

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes a new task formulation to solve complex tasks. In this new formulation, there are multiple agents, each of which is capable of solving some specific types of tasks. For example, there can be a QA agent that answers natural language (NL) questions and an instruction following agent that could execute actions to accomplish an NL intent. Given a complex task described in NL, the model is asked to communicate with each agent for their task-specific knowledge and use the returned answers to proceed with the task.\nIn this work, they instantiate the complex task as multi-hop QA and the agents as a TextQA agent that is able to reason over large text corpus, TableQA agents that could answer questions given structured data like tables, and MathQA agent that could perform numerical reasoning. Each agent also has their own auxiliary data like (NL, answer) supervision and their independent KBs. They design a model that is able to decompose a multi-hop question to simple questions that could be answered by one agent. They compare this model with other black-box models that do not perform communication with agents and show significant improvements on a synthetic dataset they create. ",
    "strengths": "- The proposed new task formulation is novel and interesting. Intuitively, it is a promising way to resolve the complex tasks people encounter daily. The paper also provides a detailed and clear definition of this new task. ",
    "weaknesses": "- The instantiation of the task could not fully justify the benefit of the new task formulation. In this new proposed setting, an ideal criterion for designing individual agents is that each has mutually exclusive functionalities, and it is challenging to develop a unified model. For example, the google search agent and the Alexa shopping agent described in the introduction make such a case. However, this work design a synthetic dataset, and the agents are separated by the different forms of knowledge (text vs table) and the different proportions of knowledge in the KB. This separation is OK as long as it could reveal the true distribution in reality -- there is some knowledge that is more accessible through text than structured data and vice versa. However, the data construction process did not consider this and did a random split. A more realistic setting will bring up some interesting questions like \"how does the decomposer know which agent is more suitable to answer the current question?\", \" how can we curate such annotations?\" etc, which are not explicitly touched by the current work. To me, my main takeaway is that question decomposition is helpful, which has been studied in previous works like BREAK (Wolfson el at + 2020). Related to this concern, I also have a question regarding training the question decomposition component. According to F3, the NL questions to the text agent and the table agent look pretty similar (e.g. [table] What movies has #1 written? vs. [text] #1 produces which materials?), what are the supervision signals that hint the model to predict one agent over another?\n- Some descriptions of the experiment setting are somewhat vague, and therefore it is not super clear whether the comparisons are fair. My main question is how factual knowledge is provided to each model? \n     * In *Models with Access to Agent Knowledge*, how do you construct the context? Do you randomly sample some context from the *possible world* of the question? \n     * Do you somehow distinguish the source (e.g., knowledge of TextQA, knowledge of TableQA)? \n     * After decomposing the question through `NextGen`, how do you provide the context when querying an individual agent? Do you provide the ground truth context without distractors? Or do you train some retriever (like in *Models with Fact Supervision*) to retrieve the context? ",

    "paper_summary": "The paper introduces an approach for easily incorporating both lexical and syntactic constraints to a model for sentence paraphrasing. Lexical constraints include words that are desirable to appear in the paraphrase, while syntactic constraints involve desired surface forms. Under CGPG, constraints are represented as text sequences that are concatenated to the source sentence. These concatenated inputs are then used to fine-tune pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models (e.g. ProphetNet, BART). A challenging aspect in this task is to obtain training data with constraint information, since datasets for paraphrasing only include <sentence, paraphrase> pairs. The authors experiment with different methods for constraint generation, following previous work. For syntactic constraints, in particular, the authors also propose a new method for extracting exemplars based on syntax similarity, called SSE. An exemplar is a natural sentence with a desired surface form for the output paraphrase. At training time, previous work generates these exemplars by replacing words in the target sentence. In contrast, the authors propose to use other natural sentences in the training set that have similar a syntactic structure to the target sentence. Automatic evaluation shows that GCPG + SSE achieves better scores than previous work on two paraphrasing datasets. The authors also conduct some human evaluation experiments, and analyse some of the characteristics of the output paraphrases to show the benefits of their proposed model. ",
    "strengths": "1. The proposed GCPG approach obtains significant better results than previous work, and appears to be simple to implement. This could motivate its application in other text-to-text generation tasks.\n2. The proposed SSE method for extracting syntactic constraints seems reasonable, and it could be implemented using bigger and more diverse datasets (if I understand the approach correctly), expanding its applicability.\n3. The methodology described is mostly appropriate, which makes the conclusions more reliable. I particularly appreciate that the authors conducted a human evaluation study, and that they attempted to analyse quantitatively some characteristics of the outputs that make them better than previous work. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. More emphasis could be given to explaining what the approach is actually doing better than previous ones. The model’s outputs do obtain higher scores using automatic metrics. However, I think the paper would benefit from more in-depth analysis of where this improvement comes from. Section 4.4 goes in the right direction by showing that models trained using GCPG suffer less from he copying problem and are able to generate more diverse ngrams than simply using ProphetNet or ParafraGPT. However, this does not show if the outputs actually better follow the constraints provided: how frequently and correctly do the outputs do incorporate the lexical items indicated as constraints better than previous work? How frequently and correctly do the outputs follow the syntactic structure of the exemplar (for example) better than previous work?\n2. Automatic evaluation shows (according to Table 2) that GCPG outperforms previous work in almost all metrics, but TED. Do the authors have an intuition (or better yet, evidence) of why this happens? As far as I understand, TED intends to measure how close the syntactic trees of both reference and outputs are, which is indicative of how much the model actually followed the syntactic condition. If that’s the case, then GCPG models are not better than CGEN and SGCP for this important criteria. However, this only happens in the ParaNMT dataset and not in QQP-Pos. Could the authors suggest an explanation for this? Is it related to the metric itself or maybe to some characteristics of the datasets?\n3. In NLG tasks, human evaluation is especially important. As such, I would request the authors to provide more details about the methodology they followed. For instance, it would be helpful to know: (a) how was the quality of the data collected ensured considering how noisy crowdsourced scores can be? what type of quality controls were implemented; (b) what was the interannotator agreement/reliability for the data collected?; ( c) what were the exact instructions provided to the crowdworkers? The authors provide very short explanations for loyalty (meaning preservation? adequacy?), fluency and, specially, syntax similarity. For this last one, in particular, it is important to know how the annotators were instructed (maybe trained?) to assess it.\n4. It is curious that, in the human evaluation study, the authors did not include results for GCPG-S only (Table 4). This would have helped support the statements that combining lexical and syntax constraints contribute to obtain better paraphrases, rather than applying them independently, which is somewhat suggested by the automatic evaluation. ",
    "comments": "1. I strongly recommend to explicitly state from the beginning of the paper the language that is being studied. On why that is important, I would suggest reading **Data Statements for Natural Language Processing: Toward Mitigating System Bias and Enabling Better Science** (Bender and Friedman, 2018) or https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/ 2. I think readers unfamiliar with the area could appreciate more motivation for controllability in paraphrasing. For instance, in lines 43-44, the authors state that “lacking control might result in undesirable results”. Perhaps mentioning a couple of such “undesirable” outcomes could help with explaining why this type of controllability is important/necessary. Same with line 46, where the authors state “To obtain desirable surface forms..”. It could help to provide an example of a real-world situation/application where a user would want to indicate a desirable syntactic form for the output paraphrase. For example, in Text Simplification, one might know that a certain target audience benefits from reading sentences expressed in active voice. So, one could attempt to control the paraphrasing based on that syntactic structure.\n3. In lines 70-71, the authors state: “Since sentential exemplar are only available for testing, …”. At this point, the reader does not know that this is due to the way the available datasets for paraphrasing have been created (explained later in the paper). I think it would help to briefly explain why this happens, or to link the reader to the section of the paper where this is explained.\n4. Lines 211-214: The authors indicate that the conditions are concatenated to the source sentences via the [SEP] token. At this point, by looking at Figure 2, it would seem that more than one syntactic constraint can be concatenated at the time. However, by looking at the Experiments section, that’s not the case. Maybe it would be helpful to clarify that tin the Figure caption. In addition, how are syntactic and lexical conditions combined before being concatenated to the source sentence? Are they also separated by a [SEP] token among themselves?\n5. The Exemplar Dictionary plays a key role in generating training instances. As such, it would be beneficial for reproducibility to provide more details on how it was constructed. My guess is that for every sentence in the training set, its truncated LCT was obtained, and then a dictionary was created with these LCT being keys. If any other further post-processing or filtering was performed, then I think it should be stated. In addition, could the authors provide more information about the size of the dictionary and the average number of natural sentences for each LCT? Finally, according to my understanding, any dataset could be used to create this Exemplar Dictionary since the LCTs are obtained automatically from any sentence. Is there any specific reason why the authors decided to use the training set and not a perhaps bigger dataset that would provide more variability to the exemplars?\n6.  Lines 301-328. This section explains how the Lexical Conditions are extracted for both the training and the test sets. However, it is confusing, mainly for the test set. At first, the authors state that two strategies are used: one extracting keywords from the references, and another using a sequence-to-sequence model to predict them from the source sentence. Then the authors say that they used three methods: TF-IDF, TextRank and KeyBERT. As far as I know, neither of those three are sequence to sequence models. So, was that second strategy from (Liu et al.,  2020a) actually used? Looking at Table 3, it does not appear anywhere either.\n7. In Table 2, the authors use “B-R” (BLEU-R), shouldn’t it be BLEU-4?\n8.

They run their model on three datasets, namely CNN/DM, arXiv, and Pubmed, showing their system staying competitive (in some cases outperforms model-wise baselines). ",

In other words, it is still unclear where the improvements of HiStruct+ (Roberta-base) vs. BERTSUMEXT are coming from? Are they because of the hierarchical info injection, or simply because of Roberta-base LM?\n-The paper does not include the human evaluation process, which is an integral part of the summarization system setup. This gets, especially, higher priority as the results of the HiStruct+ model vs. baselines are close to each other. \n  -While results are promising when comparing HiStruct+ with the reproduced baselines (Table 2), the proposed model still does nor outperform the abstractive SOTA.

    "paper_summary": "The paper introduces the Pragmatic Rational Speaker framework that allows a speaker to take the listener’s disparities into account when communicating. This framework is designed with a disparity adjustment layer into the working memory of the speaker, which would lead a speaker to adjust their lexical and semantic language while speaking, on top of the long-term memory. Through this, the working memory would be constantly updated to modify the speaker’s language based on the different listeners.  The paper’s authors create a dataset to imitate the two types of disparity, including “vocabulary limitation” and “visual access”. This is then used in experimentation which initially follows the Rational Speech Act (which this paper also extends), and the models are evaluated along the performance (measures the accuracy of the collaborative game), efficiency (measures time used for model training), and transparency (shift in vocabulary that is used in accordance with different speakers). In the end, the authors notice that the framework designed increases the game performance and shifts language to accommodate the listener’s understanding. The paper list several limitations, however, of the study that need future work, including how the generated captions do not entirely and accurately represent the image at hand due to various interactions within the image itself. ",
    "strengths": "The paper is thorough and describes a novel method to understanding the listener’s disparity as the speaker communicates. This is also the first model that proves the shift in semantic and lexical dialogue of the speaker, when other studies do not provide this, and the empirical results clearly show this. The paper introduces both a dataset and collaborative game that allows the models to be tested in a simulated environment. In turn, this will be especially helpful to ACL readers.\nThe Related Work section is also especially helpful and introduces the concepts covered in the paper in an easy-to-follow format. It clearly shows the Rational Speaker Act, the previous work that the paper extends, and introduces why the authors of the paper applied the disparity adjustment layer to the working memory. ",
    "weaknesses": "The methodology used in the paper to test the models is interesting, as the speaker and listener simulation is done in a collaborative game. However, how well does this game model the complexities of real-life communication and the speaker? The authors also list that the image captioning model does not entirely represent the image most accurately, which could bring concerns upon the “transparency” measurement of this simulation. Moreover, speakers adjust their thinking to accommodate listener disparity in many ways, some of which come from incoming people or the environment that they are in (this is acknowledged in the Conclusion and Future Work section). A lack of including this in the simulation may be a cause of concern. ",

    "paper_summary": "The authors present a method of calibrating learned multiclass classification models during training, that is, improving model calibration (in other words, pushing accuracy-versus-model-confidence graphs towards the identity line---well-calibrated models have confidence perfectly reflecting prediction accuracy).\nThe proposed method is done during training, rather than being a post-hoc model which recalibrates a learned model to maximize performance on a held-out calibration set. This has the benefit of allowing the model to use the whole train set (i.e. not requiring a held-out calibration set), in addition to ideally leveraging the entire train set to do calibration. In this sense it follows a small number of published methods.\nOverall the core writeup of the method (sec 3) was difficult to follow. The core design decisions of the method were difficult to find the motivation of. I believe the decisions pivot around an increased sample-efficiency claim (line 316), but this claim was not stated precisely (the free variable $\\epsilon$ bounds \"calibration error,\" which I do not believe is defined), and the claim does not have a proof, so the relationship between the system setup decisions and sample efficiency claims is not at all clear.\nGenerally, the calibrated systems' plots do not seem obviously notably superior to the baseline calibrations (Fig 2, Fig 1(top)), though the methods do indeed achieve superior ECE (expected calibration error) performance across some of the tasks (xSLUE, a suite of multiclass classification NLP tasks, Table 1) and, somewhat surprisingly, superior top-level accuracy/F1 (table 1).\nGiven the importance of proper calibration to so many applications of NLP, I suspect these methods would be of interest to practitioners in the field even if they do not provide an across-the-board calibration improvement, but it is not clear from the writeup when they work and when they do not.  That is, this writeup does not really address the question \"when should a practitioner use this very complex method of calibration, rather than the much conceptually simpler post-hoc Platt scaling, given that the curves in Fig 2 and Fig 1 seem to hint that the calibration benefits of this method seem to be very noisy.\" Is there a property of the dataset or predictor where we can expect this method to really help?\nGenerally, I think with notable revisions this paper would be of interest to practitioners, but it is somewhat difficult to follow the method exactly and know how we should expect it to affect performance on a given novel task. ",
    "strengths": "- The authors present a novel calibration technique in multiclass classification setups that leverages the entire train set (rather than a held-out calibration set). This method learns both a Platt-scaling transform (an affine transform on logits, basically), in addition to iteratively adaptively binning the train set based on this learned transform, I believe so that we can calculate the ECE without a held-out set.\n- The proposed methods perform superior to baselines with respect to calibration error on more tasks than they perform worse.\n- The proposed modifications improve against the baseline MLE systems in terms of accuracy/F1 across many tasks; that is, the calibration term appears to act as an effective model regularizer in some setups. ",
    "weaknesses": "- The technical description of the method (sec 3) was quite difficult to follow. The central methodological decisions (adaptive binning, discretization thereafter by doing what appears to be essentially isotonic regression) were difficult to find the motivation of. I believe these decisions center around being able to make a sample efficiency claim (line 317), but I'm not sure why this method gives that sample efficiency property, and no proof of the claim is presented. More concrete questions/concerns are given in \"comments\" below, written as I read the presentation.\n- There are a few properties of the evaluation/results which are a bit confusing and call conclusions into question. For example:   - PosPS (post-hoc Platt Scaling) is lower than MLE in accuracy on a few tasks---If I understand correctly, this should not be true in principle, since the max predictions are supposed to be invariant. Is this just model retrain noise from starting off at different initial model params? Or do I misunderstand? \n  - The reliability diagrams (Fig 1, top), that is the accuracy vs confidence plots, certainly don't make the proposed methods look better (a perfect system will have the identify function here), and in fact exhibit some pretty notable pathologies (high-accuracy spikes in low confidence regimes, e.g.). Is this a property of dataset pathologies or does it reflect variance/unpredictability in the proposed methods? \n  - In the ECE-versus-number-of-bins plots in Figure 2, the two calibrated systems (PosCal and the proposed) all have ECEs (calibration performance) very close to the MLE for most values. This hints at the fact that the methods may be very sensitive to bin size and often provide no actual expected calibration improvement, is that right? How was this bin-size hyperparam selected? Was its selected value chosen from the held-out dev set without looking at test at all?\n- Difficult to see how this can extend to the structured prediction encoder/decoder setups used quite often across NLP. Does this only work for relatively few-class multiclass classification? This is not a fatal flaw. ",
    "comments": "- \"These observations prove the efficacy of our method in maintaining a perfect balance between model performance and model uncertainity-a testimony of an ideal calibrator\" this is a pretty over-the-top claim! \" Perfect balance?\" This doesn seem like isn't an \"ideal calibrator,\" it has nontrivial ECE still, right? I'd scale this paragraph's claims back to things that are empirically supportable - tab 2 is somewhat confusing. Can you turn P1 and P2 into one confusion matrix per row and present it that way? These different columns are all just very different sort of things, strange that they're presented next to each other - What is Fig 2's dataset? the average across all the tasks? Just one task?\n- The definition of perfect calibration in the info is perhaps a bit confusing as-is (namely, $P$ has to be a joint over the covariates $x$ and the predictions $f$ right so you need some sort of metric over both, is that right? Or perhaps you just require $f$ to be Borel-measurable and deterministic or something. ( Unrelatedly, I also realize that if $f$ is itself nondeterministic, then you probably need an expectation operator right?). Anyways, it might be helpful to add a short sentence to the text here explaining this eq in words, no need to be too precise.\n- Is the output of step (3) differentiable? Do you need subgradients or something to get the loss? I guess this is why it's helpful to know exactly what $\\beta$ is.\n- A nit but i might use something other than \"distance\" to describe $d$ in line 231, since it's not in general a valid distance metric, maybe \"calibration mismatch\" or something.\n- Also maybe change $q$ to $\\hat q$ in the eq on line 232? Since the thing you're minimizing isn't the true value $q$, which we don't have access to even in principle.\n- I'm a bit perplexed by the discrepancy between the matrix $Q$, which is essentially a function of the predictor network, and the $q$ in 232, which is not. Does $Q$ as given suffice to allow us to calculate arbitrary distance functionals between $p$ and $q$, as described in line 231?\n- You haven't defined calibration error but instantiate it via $\\epsilon$ in line 254. It's abs(p - q) to use the terminology of line (232), is that right? ECE is usually given with the expectation randomness integrating over the simplex $D_K$ right, do we have to do that here? Not sure if this is essential to get all the details precise here but probably it would be good to define what \"calibration error\" is at the least.\n- Don't think you define what the Platt-scaling set $G$ is ranged over by the argmin in step 1.\n- What is the set $\\beta$ in line 311?\n- It's not clear to me why step (3) of the algorithm should be necessary at all. It seems like this wouldn't change the calibration but allows us to estimate the ECE? Is that right? Or does this adaptive binning + discretization (essentially isotonic regression, right?) actually affect calibration in expectation?\n- Line (7) of alg 1's pseucode is referenced in the text but the fig doesn't have line numbers, is it possible to add them \"the achieved reduction in ECE as compared to all baselines is significant\" what does this mean? Paired t-test? p < 0.05? Either describe the test or remove this significance claim - do you have a proof of the sample-efficiency claim in line 317? would be good to put this into an appendix - Is it possible to compare to MCDropout? It would be really nice to see that comparison, but this isn't crucial. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes an in-depth study of the impact of translationese on machine translation performance from a causal point-of-view, i.e. how the alignment of direction (from originally authored to translated text and vice-versa) of the model and data involved in the translation process influences BLEU scores. This differs from previous work which mostly focused on the alignment direction between the translation model and the test set.\nThe authors built an annotated corpus based on Europarl to control for variables such as original or translationese, content in terms of topics, and sentence length, and extracted comparable sub-corpora of aligned and unaligned directions to empirically show the following: aligned training and test directions perform best, alignment direction is also relevant when producing synthetic data with supervised training and back-translation, but the impact of data and model alignment varies among language pairs and translations when considering other factors.  The evaluation is conducted on five language pairs in ten translation directions with a test set sampled from the corpus built by the authors, as well as on the newstest2014 from WMT in two language pairs with four translation directions. ",

This is especially true with the large amount of synthetic data produced and used in machine translation nowadays.  An additional contribution, backed by further experiments, is the exploration of causal and anticausal learning and their impact on translation performances (based on an automatic metric) when various data directions are used, which appears to be positive or negative depending on the translation direction and language pair.  Finally, the claims made by the authors throughout the paper are supported by a solid set of experiments conducted on various translation directions, the paper is very well written and straightforward to follow.

    "weaknesses": "Due to the difficulty to build a corpus as employed in this study, the amount of data used to train the machine translation systems is relatively small when compared to publicly available corpora used for the same language pairs by the research community. Thus, the conclusions drawn by the authors might be limited to low or average data settings.\nAlso, a popular method usually employed to mitigate the alignment mismatch between train and test directions is to add a tag per sample specifying the direction. Commonly used when adding back-translations to the training data, this method could contrast with the current set of experiments and provide an interesting comparison point. The question would be, is the machine translation system able to model the direction and potentially abstract from train-test or data-model alignment mismatch. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper studies translationese effects (differences between original and translations in the same language) in machine translation. Since one cannot have parallel corpora with originals in the 2 languages simultaneously, the authors analyse which is the best configuration in data and model alignments for maximising machine translation quality. Recent literature has studied the effect that translationese has in the test sets for the evaluation, but training data and models have been less explored. For this work, the authors first compile a corpus tagged for translationese in five language pairs (causalMT) and then run several experiments on different combinations of the data to see the effect on BLEU scores. ",
    "strengths": "- The number of experiments is comprehensive - The conclusions might help MT researchers in designing their systems. This is true for language pairs where translationese information is available, but also in general when one uses back-translation or self-training ",
    "weaknesses": "- Given the nature of the work, evaluation is important. Authors argue that they cannot perform human evaluation, but at least the combination of other metrics would be relevant. COMET for instance correlates better with human judgements than BLEU [1] and goes further string matching - A couple of relevant references are missing and it would be nice to see them included in the revised version and emphasize your contributions after their works: [2] which create a similar corpus from Europarl with the addition of information about the possibility of pivot translation (which might translationese effects) and [3] which also studied the relevance of the train-test alignment in SMT translation quality (see the references in the Comments section) ",
    "comments": "- Section 4, lines 404-411. \nI don't understand this part, I'm not able to reproduce you Corr column in Table 4 from the numbers in Table 2. Table 4's caption helps a bit, but I think the explanation here is not clear enough. Also, the term correlation is confusing (at least to me). I understand your point in the definition but, still, when I read \"correlation\" I expect something between -1 and 1 that shows me how much two variables relate to each other.\n- Still in Table 4, the 3r column shouldn't be named ATE? If I understood properly Corr is also Cau-Ant.\n- Causal effect results. How does (1) and the last part of (2) match? \n\"The data-model alignment is a clear cause for MT performance.\" vs \"For other language pairs, the data-model alignment can sometimes have a distinct positive impact and can also sometimes have a negative impact.\"\n- Related to the previous point: it makes a lot of sense to me that data-model alignment affects MT performance. The fact that it does not always happen couldn't be the effect of more \"others\" in Eq.3 besides length and content?\n- I think it would be good to include some of the appendices in the main text. Some parts of the main text are duplicated (Section 6 is already found in pieces in previous sections) on the other hand some relevant information is ignored here. \nFor instance, I found Appendix E1 especially interesting as the performance quality of method used to find topic and length equivalents might affect the final quality of the generated corpora.\nReferences [1] Tom Kocmi, Christian Federmann, Roman Grundkiewicz, Marcin Junczys-Dowmunt, Hitokazu Matsushita, Arul Menezes.

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes a simple and new random intermediate layer knowledge distillation approach (RAIL-KD). The main point is to select the intermediate layers from the teacher model randomly which are distilled to the corresponding student layers. Here all layers are taken into the training without any additional parameters. So it could avoid skip and search problem and reduce the computational cost of intermediate layer distillation. The whole idea is interesting and straightforward. It is great to have many analyses in the experiments. However, I have some concerns about the performance. ",
    "strengths": "1.This paper presents a new intermediate layer knowledge distillation approach with performance improvement and low computational cost.  2.This paper adds some comparisons of the current ILD methods about the efficiency and performance. The proposed RAIL-KD has a less computational overhead.  3.In the experiments, authors compare different distillation methods under many challenge datasets. ",
    "weaknesses": "1.Adding the random selection is not a new idea. The randomness of the layer selection could cause the unstable of performance. It is better to show more results such as the convergence analysis. Random selection might not be the best option here.\n2.The performance is not convincing. The improvements under some settings are not significant.  3.The new approach could not find the best subset (subset mapping) since the proposed model just selects m layers randomly. But it is not clear if we should ignore it or solve it later. From my opinion, the attention-based approaches with best mapping search may achieve better performance. ",

    "strengths": "- The idea behind the paper is intuitive and straightforward.\n- The results are a little surprising to me and they look good.\n- Experimental details are provided in the appendix, which is good for reproducibility.\n- The authors only use Wiki103 as the distillation corpus, which is easy to reproduce and desirable for computational budgets.

    "weaknesses": "### Original comments from previous review - The main concern is the technical novelty of this paper. There is little novelty since the distillation technique is not new while the idea of cross-model training is not new, either.\n- I'm surprised that in Table 1 CLIP-T performs so badly even when finetuned. Can you explain why?\n- Is it possible that the improvement of the distilled cross-modal model comes from ensembling instead of visual grounding?\n- I suggest the authors make the weights publically available (can be anonymous during double-blind reviewing) so the results can be easily verified by the community.\nAlthough some details are vague and need further investigation, I think the contribution is enough to be accepted as a short paper.\n### After rebuttal Thanks for resubmitting the paper with a response. I've carefully read the response.\n- **Re. To Reviewer2.1**: First, distilling B task into A task improves A is not so surprising. This idea has been explored in Intermediate-Task Transfer Learning. I agree that distilling cross-modal model to a single-modal model is somewhat novel. However, even self-distillation can improve accuracy so I have no idea to what extent is cross-modal distillation helpful.\n- **Re. To Reviewer2.2**: Good answer.\n- **Re. To Reviewer2.3**: Sorry for the confusion. Yes, when fine-tuning there is only the BERT encoder used. However, I suspect that substituting CLIP with any pretrained LM would also work. But again, as the authors point out, \"the linguistic competence is CLIP-T very low\" so this paper has some insights and presents previously unknown results. That's why I gave this paper a score of 3.5.\n- **Re. To Reviewer2.4**: That should be easy. Just manually reassign the weights in the original `state_dict` to a `state_dict` of a Hugging Face BERT model. That would work.\nThus, I keep my recommendation of weak acceptance for this paper and I suggest other reviewers consider increasing their scores. ",

This leads to the suggestions,that these models generalize better than other models. Select-then-predict models also perform surprisingly well in out-of-domain settings.

    "paper_summary": "The paper works on creating sentence embeddings targeting the semantic similarity (STS) task. It identifies a core issue in two previous approaches. The discrete augmentation approaches (Wu et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2021) sometimes distorts semantic meaning of sentences, creating positive pairs that do not indeed have the same meaning. For this, the paper purposes a stronger baseline based on semantic role labeling (SRL). On the other hand, the more promising continuous augmentation approaches (Carlsson et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2021) only have positive training examples that are embeddings that come from identical sentences, which introduce cues about sentence length. The paper then verifies this issue by showing a performance drop of one such method SimCSE when such cue is manually removed.  The paper then proposes a remedy to said issue by mapping the representations of both positive and negative examples to a pseudo sentence with the same length and structure. The proposed approach proves effective by achieving new state-of-the-art on several STS benchmarks. Analyses also show that the pseudo tokens play an important role. ",
    "strengths": "- The paper identifies an intuitive issue of the current SOTA method (i.e., Gao et al., 2021) that uses embeddings from the same sentence, though with different drop-out masks, as positive examples. Such issue of relying on sentence length is exposed by manually removing the cue of length from the dataset. This strongly motivates the paper's subsequent modeling endeavors.  - The paper proposes a model that is seemingly sound to address the previous issue.\n- The paper shows through evaluation on a suite of benchmarks that the proposed method is superior. There are also adequate analysis showing that the core idea of the method, pseudo tokens, does play an important role. ",
    "weaknesses": "- The paper hypothesizes that SimCSE suffers from the cue of sentence length and syntax. However, the experiments only targets sentence length but not syntax.  - The writing of this paper can benefit by some work (see more below). Specifically, I find Section 3 difficult to understand as someone who does not directly work on this task. Specifically, a good mount of terminologies are introduced without explanations. I suggest a good effort of rewriting this section to be easier understandable by general NLP researchers.\n- Though a universal issue in related papers and should not be blamed on the authors, why only consider BERT-base? It is known that other models such as BERT-large, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, etc. could produce better embeddings, and that the observations in these works do not necessarily hold in those larger and better models.  - The introduction of the SRL-based discrete augmentation approach (line 434 onwards) is unclear and cannot be possibly understood by readers without any experience in SRL. I suggest at least discussing the following:   - Intuitively why relying on semantic roles is better than work like CLEAR   - What SRL model you use   - What the sequence \"[ARG0, PRED, ARGM − NEG, ARG1]\" mean, and what these PropBank labels mean   - What is your reason of using this sequence as opposed to alternatives ",

I am not surprised since positive example pair in SimCSE is constructed by applying different dropout masks twice to the feedforward layer of the Transformer models, while the input to the Transformer model remains untouched.       -- I think sentence length side-effect is an issue of engineering/implementation, and can also be addressed from engineering side.  For example, one could implement a sampling procedure where all examples in the same batch have similar number of tokens.   The paper argues that the SimCSE model also affected by \"syntactic structures\".  It would be great to have some examples or more descriptions on what does \"syntactic structures\" referring to.\nRegarding the proposed model:   -- If I understand correctly, Y_i in eq 1 is the sentence embedding induced by BERT model.  In such case, the attention in EQ1 would always output a weight matrix of shape [m, 1], i.e., a vector of all 1s.  Here m denotes the number of pseudo tokens. This is because there is only one key in the dictionary, i.e., the sentence embedding.  Thus all attention weights are put on that key.\nRegarding the experiments.

Thus the authors propose a method, where they incorporate pseudo embedding and momentum updating to further help the contrastive learning.\nExperiments over multiple downstream tasks, mostly over semantic similarity benchmarks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, mostly compared to the recent SimCSE method.

The problems of existing models that the authors presented are really crucial for better text embedding.

They include also additional beneficial analyses at the end of the paper, such as alignment and uniformity measurements. ",
    "weaknesses": "The paper is written in a way that only readers that are familiar with MoCo can follow this work. For example, the authors write about a “dictionary”, and a “memory bank” without providing further explanations about how they use them and how they are composed. The paper should be more self-contained and is pretty hard to follow in its current form.\nIt is not clear to me how the pseudo sentences are actually generated. The authors write “During training, we 397 create a pseudo sentence {0, 1, 2, ..., 127} for every 398 input and map the original sentence to this pseudo sentence by attention”, but how exactly is a different pseudo embedding is created per sentence? According to Fig 2, all the pseudo sentences are the same, and I can’t see what is the motivation for that (In Fig 1 we can correctly see different sentences per instance). If there is a different pseudo sentence per sentence, then the mapping strategy is missing from the paper.\nOne discrete data augmentation ablation missing from the paper is the synonym/paraphrase replacement method (e.g., [1]) which matches the (correct) intuition of the authors, presented in Fig 1.\nA comment about the architecture: There is neither intuition nor motivation as to why a single same attention layer should be used for both stages of obtaining the sentence embedding (Eq. 1 and 3). Also, an ablation regarding the architecture is missing, e.g., a number of layers, using different sets of parameters in Eq 1 and 3, etc., which could have been at least added to the appendix in case there is no space left.\nRegarding the evaluations, an interesting missing evaluation is single-sentence classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, which was carried out in similar papers (SimCSE). I encourage the authors to add such important analysis to their revised version of the paper. Also, there is no code available and hyperparameter choices are not depicted at all.\nLastly, the paper lacks some interesting/cherry-picked examples for sentences that can provide some insights regarding the method. A PCA/TSNE plot of the new embeddings compared to the previous embeddings can be informative to show the changes after post-processing.

They construct this dataset by collecting a wealth of statistical reports and Wikipedia pages, and then asking human annotators to convert sentence descriptions into question-answer pairs. Nearly all tables in the dataset are hierarchical, with fine-grained annotations of quantity and entity alignment. They evaluate two tasks on this dataset: table QA and natural language generation. They show that complex hierarchical structures increase the difficulty of both table QA and text generation. ",

This avoids annotation artifacts and bias to some extent.  There are some other strengths as follows:  - Good efforts are spent to build this dataset, with 18 annotators and 2400 working hours. Besides the hierarchical tables,  - Automatic Evaluation (Section 2.4) and Human Inspections (Section 2.5) are conducted in the dataset construction process to ensure the data quality.  - The details of dataset construction are well-presented in the paper and the Appendix.

I suggest the authors put this part into the main paper, and I expect to see more results and analysis towards this direction to reveal how SOTA QA models fail in facing with complex hierarchical structures.

In this case, we might be able to learn the hierarchical information through the self-attention mechanism built in Transformers. ",

    "comments": "=== General comments === Is cross-model prompt transfer something that would be useful in practice? If so, it would be helpful to add some motivation for why this is an interesting problem to solve.\nLester et al. 2021 found the original T5 checkpoints didn't work well for prompt tuning, and used LM-adapted checkpoints instead. Is this work using the original checkpoints? If so, it might be interesting to comment on why they might be working well here but not there. A related question: Is the evaluation of T5 for classification tasks doing unconstrained generation, or is it a \"ranking\" approach, just scoring the likelihood of the legal labels?\nVu et al. 2021 is mentioned as \"concurrent\", but was online 3 months before the ARR Jan deadline, so should be considered \"recent\", not concurrent. See the Citation section here: https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Policies_for_Submission,_Review_and_Citation Vu et al. 2021 seems very similar: (1) investigates prompt transfer through initialization, (2) tests different transferability indicators, (3) discusses building a \"prompt warehouse\" for retrieving related tasks and improving prompt tuning. It would be useful to include a bit more description of their approach and the differences/similarities with this work.\n=== Specific comments === p.2 -- It's not clear what TPT stands for when the term is introduced.\np.2,3 -- In introducing \"soft prompts\" (p.2) and prompt tuning (section 3.1), the Li and Liang 2021 paper is presented as just tuning input embedding vectors. However Li and Liang's core results are using \"prefix tuning\" which overwrites activations in intermediate layers as well. This should be clarified. Lester et al. 2021 may be a better reference for tuning prompts that only affect the input layer.\np.3 \"In this work, we show that prompt transfer can remedy, improve the effectiveness to some extent with knowledge transfer, and empirically analyze the transferability of prompts across tasks and PLMs.\" -- Grammar seems off here.\np.4 I'm confused why Fig 3b laptop => laptop is 99. Shouldn't the diagonal be 100 by definition? If not, it would be useful to explain why not.\np.4 \"Considering RoBERTa can only predict a single token\" -- I'm not understanding why RoBERTa can't be used for extractive QA tasks. Isn't this typically done by adding a QA head on top of BERT type models? Would that not work here? If not, it would be useful to explain why not.\np.5 \"a larger and heterogeneous target PLM\" -- I'm not sure what heterogeneous means here.\np.5 \"In the experiments, we select laptop and MNLI for the projector learning.\" -- Could you say why these two tasks were selected?\np.5 The description of Distance Minimizing and Task Tuning could be clearer. From Table 2, it looks like these methods are only training the projector on one task at a time? For Distance Minimizing, does this mean you're training a perceptron on a single datapoint? Does the loss go to 0 in this case? I'm surprised the laptop=>laptop and MNLI=>MNLI transfer scores aren't 100%. Could you say more about how many datapoints you're training on and how many steps of optimization you do?\np.6 For Task Tuning, training the projector directly on the training task examples seems very similar to prompt tuning itself. Is there any added value to training the projector weights as opposed to just optimizing the projector's output (the prompt) directly?   p.6 Are C_concat and C_average the same prompt similarity metrics used in Vu et al. 2021? If so it would be useful to mention this.\np.8 Is there a reason why T5 XL size is left out of Figure 4? ",

    "paper_summary": "Motivated by empirical findings that training models with Prompt Tuning can achieve the same performance as fully fine-tuning a model, but the training takes much longer to reach the same performance, they explore ways to exploit knowledge from already trained prompts.\nThey explore using already trained prompts to transfer knowledge between tasks (using the same frozen model) and also the transfer of prompt between _different_ frozen models. For between task transfer, they either directly re-use a prompt from a source task on the target task or they use the prompt learned from the source task as the initialization point for the target task.\nFor between model transfer, they uses these same methods but include a learnable `projector` (a small, 2 layer neural-network) that maps the prompts from one frozen model to another be using the projected prompt in one of the methods mentioned above. They have two methods for learning this `projector`. In the first method, which they call _Distance Minimization_, they minimize the $L_2$ distance between a projected source prompt (trained on the source frozen model) and a target prompt (a prompt trained on the same task using the target model). In the second method (_Task Tuning_) they learn the `projector` via backpropagation. In this case they take a prompt trained on a source task $P_s$, project it ($Proj(P_s)$) and then use that when prompt tuning the target model. Gradient updates are only applied to the projector.\nThey also look at several methods of prompt similarity and use them to predict prompt transferability. They main methods are Cosine and Euclidean distances between prompt tokens and their novel model activation similarity where prompts are fed into frozen models and the activations of the feed-forward layers are recorded. The call this method _ON_. ### Results Their first results look at the performance of directly re-using a prompt trained on a source task for a downstream task. They find that this can produce strong performance (measured in relative performance, the direct source to target prompt transfer performance divided by the performance researched from directly training on the target task) within clusters of similar tasks.\nTheir second results look at the performance of using a prompt learned on a source task to initialize the prompt for a target task and then doing Prompt Tuning. They find that this method can give consistent gains in terms of task performance as well as speed of convergence.\nTheir third set results examine transfer across models. They find that direct re-use of a prompt projected by the `projector` learned via the _Distance Minimization_ method results in poor performance, especially within the Sentiment tasks. They find that direct reuse of a prompt projected by a `projector` learned with their _Task Tuning_ method does better especially when the tasks are within the same cluster. They also look at how using a _Task Tuning_ prompt to initialize training of a new prompt performs and finds that it can lead to some improvements in task performance and small improvements in convergence speed.\nTheir final set of results examine use prompt similarity methods to predict prompt transferablity (in the context of direct prompt reuse). They find that all methods are able to distinguish between multiple prompts (created by training with different random seeds) trained for the same task from prompts trained for other tasks. They also find that _ON_ produces a ranking of similar prompts that best correlate with direct reuse performance (using Spearman's rank correlation scores). They also find that the correlation decreases as the size of the frozen model grows. ",
    "strengths": "The strengths of the paper include:  * Experiments on many different and diverse datasets, 17 with a good mixture of sentiment, NLI, EJ, Paraphrase detection, and Question answers. \n  * Experiments across many model sizes and architectures, including encoder-only models like RoBERTa instead of just the encoder-decoder and decoder-only models we see else where. \n  * The inclusion of small motivating experiments like the convergence speed are a great way to establish the importance of the work and the impact it would have. \n   * The use of the same methods (direct reuse of prompts and using prompts as initialization) in different settings (cross task transfer with the same model and cross model transfer with the same task) and similar results in each demonstrate the robustness of the method. \n   * Not only does their novel prompt similarity method (_ON_ based on model activations when processing the prompt) work great at predicting direct use similarity, it also captures the non-linear way the model interacts with the prompt in a way that simple methods like token similarity can. ",
    "weaknesses": "The majority of the weaknesses in the paper seem to stem from confusion and inconsistencies between some of the prose and the results.\n1. Figure 2, as it is, isn't totally convincing there is a gap in convergence times. The x-axis of the graph is time, when it would have been more convincing using steps. Without an efficient, factored attention for prompting implementation a la [He et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04366) prompt tuning can cause slow downs from the increased sequence length. With time on the x-axis it is unclear if prompt tuning requires more steps or if each step just takes more time. Similarly, this work uses $0.001$ for the learning rate. This is a lot  smaller than the suggested learning rate of $0.3$ in [Lester et al (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.243/), it would have been better to see if a larger learning rate would have closed this gap. Finally, this gap with finetuning is used as a motivating examples but the faster convergence times of things like their initialization strategy is never compared to finetuning. \n2. Confusion around output space and label extraction. In the prose (and Appendix A.3) it is stated that labels are based on the predictions at `[MASK]` for RoBERTa Models and the T5 Decoder for generation. Scores in the paper, for example the random vector baseline for T5 in Table 2 suggest that the output space is restricted to only valid labels as a random vector of T5 generally produces nothing. Using this rank classification approach should be stated plainly as direct prompt reuse is unlikely to work for actual T5 generation. \n3. The `laptop` and `restaurant` datasets don't seem to match their descriptions in the appendix. It is stated that they have 3 labels but their random vector performance is about 20% suggesting they actually have 5 labels? \n4. Some relative performance numbers in Figure 3 are really surprising, things like $1$ for `MRPC` to `resturant` transfer seem far too low, `laptop` source to `laptop` target on T5 doesn't get 100, Are there errors in the figure or is where something going wrong with the datasets or implementation? \n5. Prompt similarities are evaluated based on correlation with zero-shot performance for direct prompt transfer. Given that very few direct prompt transfers yield gain in performance, what is actually important  when it comes to prompt transferability is how well the prompt works as an initialization and does that boost performance. Prompt similarity tracking zero-shot performance will be a good metric if that is in turn correlated with transfer performance.  The numbers from Table 1 generally support that this as a good proxy method as 76% of datasets show small improvements when using the best zero-shot performing prompt as initialization when using T5 (although only 54% of datasets show improvement for RoBERTa). However Table 2 suggests that this zero-shot performance isn't well correlated with transfer performance. In only 38% of datasets does the best zero-shot prompt match the best prompt to use for transfer (And of these 5 successes 3 of them are based on using MNLI, a dataset well known for giving strong transfer results [(Phang et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01088)). Given that zero-shot performance doesn't seem to be correlated with transfer performance (and that zero-shot transfer is relatively easy to compute) it seems like _ON_'s strong correlation would not be very useful in practice. \n6. While recent enough that it is totally fair to call [Vu et al., (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07904) concurrent work, given the similarity of several approaches there should be a deeper discussion comparing the two works. Both the prompt transfer via initialization and the prompt similarity as a proxy for transferability are present in that work. Given the numerous differences (Vu et al transfer mostly focuses on large mixtures transferring to tasks and performance while this work focuses on task to task transfer with an eye towards speed. _ ON_ as an improvement over the Cosine similarities which are also present in Vu et al) it seems this section should be expanded considering how much overlap there is. \n7. The majority of Model  transfer results seem difficult to leverage. Compared to cross-task transfer, the gains are minimal and the convergence speed ups are small. Coupled with the extra time it takes to train the projector for _Task Tuning_ (which back propagation with the target model) it seems hard to imagine situations where this method is worth doing (that knowledge is useful). Similarly, the claim on line 109 that model transfer can significantly accelerate prompt tuning seems lie an over-claim. \n8. Line 118 claims `embedding distances of prompts do not well indicate prompt transferability` but Table 4 shows that C$_{\\text{average}}$ is not far behind _ON_. This claim seems over-reaching and should instead be something like \"our novel method of measuring prompt similarity via model activations is better correlated with transfer performance than embedding distance based measures\" ",
    "comments": "1. Line 038: They state that GPT-3 showed extremely large LM can give remarkable improvements. I think it would be correct to have one of their later citations on continually developed LM as the one that showed that. GPT-3 mostly showed promise for Few-Shot evaluation, not that it get really good performance on downstream tasks. \n2. Line 148: I think it would make sense to make a distinction between hard prompt work updates the frozen model (Schick and Schütez, etc) from ones that don't. \n3. Line 153: I think it makes sense to include [_Learning How to Ask: Querying LMs with Mixtures of Soft Prompts_ (Qin and Eisner, 2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.410.pdf) in the citation list for work on soft prompts. \n4. Figure 3: The coloring of the PI group makes the text very hard to read in Black and White. \n5. Table 1: Including the fact that the prompt used for initialization is the one that performed best in direct transfer in the caption as well as the prose would make the table more self contained. \n6. Table 2: Mentioning that the prompt used as cross model initialization is from _Task Tuning_ in the caption would make the table more self contained. \n7. Line 512: It is mentioned that _ON_ has a drop when applied to T$5_{\\text{XXL}}$ and it is suggested this has to do with redundancy as the models grow. I think this section could be improved by highlighting that the Cosine based metrics have a similar drop (suggesting this is a fact of the model rather than the fault of the _ON_ method). Similarly, Figure 4 shows the dropping correlation as the model grows. Pointing out the that the _ON_ correlation for RoBERTA$_{\\text{large}}$ would fit the tend of correlation vs model size (being between T5 Base and T5 Large) also strengths the argument but showing it isn't an artifact of _ON_ working poorly on encoder-decoder models. I think this section should also be reordered to show that this drop is correlated with model size. Then the section can be ended with hypothesizing and limited exploration of model redundancy. \n8. Figure 6. It would have been interesting to see how the unified label space worked for T5 rather than RoBERTAa as the generative nature of T5's decoding is probably more vulnerable to issue stemming from different labels. \n9. _ ON_ could be pushed farther. An advantage of prompt tuning is that the prompt is transformed by the models attention based on the value of the prompt. Without having an input to the model, the prompts activations are most likely dissimilar to the kind of activations one would expect when actually using the prompt. \n10.

    "paper_summary": "This paper aims to improve the quality of arbitrary translation directions (arbitrary \"XY\" translation) for a multilingual NMT (MNMT) system. The proposed approach consists of two stages: 1) Pretrain an NMT model on all available parallel data between any languages; 2) Finetune the model on \"many-to-one\" data for all target languages (multilingual many-to-one finetuning). The paper also studied large-scale training with in-house settings, including En-centric vs. multilingual-centric pretraining, and light-weight decoder architecture. Experimental results on WMT21 demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed direct bi-lingual systems and pivot translation systems. ",
    "strengths": "This paper addresses and important problem of improving arbitrary translation directions between any language pairs in an NMT system, which is not well solved yet.

    "comments": "Regarding the proposed approach 1. The proposed approach requires producing |L| finetuned models, one for each target language. While this seems to be helpful in improving quality, it remains questionable how scalable this approach is, especially when extending the system to handle hundreds of languages. It would be more interesting and feasible to study the possibility of at least grouping several similar languages into one model during finetuning. \n2. If pretraining on multi-centric data performs better than En-centric data (Table 1), seems the problem can be better solved by preparing more diverse and high quality data. It remains unclear whether the improvement comes from the proposed 2-stage training, or simply collecting more relevant data.\nRegarding experiments 1. I would suggest adding one or more existing end-to-end MNMT models that enable XY translations into the baselines for comparison. Bilingual and pivot baselines are kind of weak in the multiway translation setup.\nRegarding paper organization: 1. I would suggest adding a summary of contributions in the last paragraph of Sec. 1 for clarity. \n2. It seems Sec. 2.1 should be a standalone section discussing experimental setups and results. In addition, Sec. 2.2 can also be a new section talking about in-house training procedure and results. It makes the paper a little confusing to nest everything under Sec. 2. ",

This represents a middleground: N systems have to be managed (vs N^2 bilingual system or 1 many-to-many system), but a large pretraining with all language direction has to be done only once. They report good BLEU improvement on the WMT21 multilingual translation task.\n2- They also propose to improve the inference lattency of the systems by using an \"unbalanced\" Transformer architecture with 9 encoding layers but only 2 decoding layers. This architecture can reduce decoding lattency by 50% over a \"balanced\" architecture.\n3- They also make some experiments to establish the usefulness of mult-centric pretraining over english-centric pretraining.

    "strengths": "I found the paper quite interesting , even if at times a bit unclear. The idea of fine-tuning many-to-many MT system into several many-to-one systems is simple but is shown to work well over two wmt21 tasks comprising 30 translation directions each.  Reducing the decoder depth for improving lattency do not appear so innovative to me, but it is at least interesting to see some number for the BLEU/lattency compromises this implies in a real large-scale setting.\nOverall, I think there is enough to learn from this, given it is a short paper.

    "paper_summary": "The paper addresses a fundamental shortcoming in evaluating conversational question answering (CQA) models based on the gold-annotated question-answer pairs. The existing evaluation procedure ignores the impact of the model’s output on upcoming exchanges, thereby detracting from real-world scenarios. Specifically, when a model flounders, the conversation is likely to be progressed differently than what is already annotated. The current evaluation mechanism does not account for these cases.\nThe paper first highlights this problem by using human annotators to converse with 4 CQA models, trained on QuAC. After collecting QA conversations, another group of annotators check the validity of conversations by (1) checking whether the question at each turn is valid and answerable, and (2) verifying whether the models’ answers are correct. This experiment reveals that human evaluation substantially differs from gold-answer evaluation when the relative performance of the 4 models is compared using each evaluation method.\nThe paper finds that using predicted answers while retaining existing questions suffers from 3 drawbacks: unresolved coreference, incoherence, and change in the correct answer. Since the most frequent issue was related to coreference, the paper proposes a question-rewrite method to amend references by replacing them with the original entities, mentioned in the history. This method is empirically shown to be most aligned with human evaluation when compared to other evaluation methods.\nFinally, the paper suggests 3 critical areas that future models should focus on: (1) ability to detect question dependencies, (2) ability to detect unanswered questions, (3) evaluation under real-world settings. ",
    "strengths": "- The paper focuses on an interesting problem and the insights provided in this work can be of interest to the community and spark future research.\n- The analysis of CQA models is much-needed in the literature. Once we understood where our models fall short, we can make meaningful progress in building more effective CQA models.\nOverall, I think the paper is a solid work. ",
    "weaknesses": "- My main concern with this paper is the proposed question-rewrite strategy. I’m not convinced this method covers a sufficiently large number of questions because out of 100 passages (or \\~3.7K questions based on Table 4 in the appendix), 23% become invalid (\\~850 questions), out of which 44% are attributed to unresolved coreference (\\~375 questions). As reported at L373, the proposed method rewrites 12% of the questions for all models (\\~45 questions per model), which hardly has a significant effect.\n- I don’t understand why generating question-in-context lags behind the question-rewrite method. The question-rewrite method may make a question ungrammatical (as pointed out in $\\S$B) because the original entity can be a clause or the coreference resolution tool may make mistakes. On the other hand, the question-replace model is trained to generate contextualized questions and its output is more likely to be grammatically correct. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper focuses on the task of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), which envisions a back-and-forth question answering scenario with an information-seeking goal. The work shows how the most common way of automatically evaluating CQA systems (on a popular instantiation of the task with one specific English dataset) is empirically different from how humans would evaluate the systems in an actual real-world scenario. The models use a dataset of human-human conversations and evaluation is commonly done by using the 'gold-standard' conversational history. But the human-machine conversations, which would result when the models are deployed or used, represent a fundamentally different distribution from human-human conversations. This means the current evaluation paradigm does not accurately capture the use-case and therefore, tracking modeling improvement with that evaluation paradigm will not be meaningful. The work's primary contribution is showing this discrepancy by conducting a human evaluation study where CQA systems get to interact with humans - the result human-machine conversational QA dataset is also a contribution. Further analysis shows how automated evaluation differs from human evaluation, and what human evaluation tells about current CQA modeling strategies including insights for future work. The work also puts forth a new automated evaluation paradigm that mirrors human evaluation results more closely than the existing evaluation strategy of using the gold answers. ",
    "strengths": "- The paper highlights a fundamental discrepancy between the dominant automated evaluation paradigm and human judgment of CQA models when situated in the real-world scenario - this exposition is meaningful for the CQA community in order to take stock of whether modeling improvements can be claimed with an evaluation strategy that seems to be quite broken.  - Further, the exposition of this problem in automated evaluation is carried out rigorously by conducting a user study where humans interact with different CQA models - and the resulting human-machine dataset is another important contribution. The work does also shows the different ways in which the problem with the current automated evaluation paradigm manifests itself.  - The difference in the distribution of human-human and human-machine conversations is made clear, and what that means for current automated model evaluation (such as models being ranked differently in terms of automated and human evaluation) is explained well.  - The insights derived for different modeling strategies and how they fare on human evaluation can help better understand differences and relative strengths and weaknesses of different CQA models. These insights can inform future work on CQA modeling and some solid recommendations are indeed put forth in this work.  - The paper is written clearly and organized well. The main ideas and contributions, and their importance, are presented early and quite clearly. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The case made for adopting the proposed strategy for a new automated evaluation paradigm - auto-rewrite (where the questions that are not valid due to a coreference resolution failure in terms of the previous answer get their entity replaced to be made consistent with the gold conversational history) - seems weak. While the proposed strategy does seem to do better in terms of being closer to how humans evaluated the 4 models (all in the context of one specific English dataset), it is not clear how the proposed strategy -      a) does better than the previously proposed strategy of using model-predicted history (auto-pred). Looking at the comparison results for different evaluations - in terms of table 1, there definitely does not seem to be much difference between the two strategies (auto-rewrite and auto-pred). In fig 5, for some (2/6) pairs, the pred-history strategy has higher agreement than the proposed auto-rewrite strategy while they are all at the same agreement for 1/6 pairs.      b) gets to the fundamental problem with automated evaluation raised in the paper, which is that \"when placed in realistic settings, the models never have access to the ground truth (gold answers) and are only exposed to the conversational history and the passage.\" The proposed strategy seems to need gold answers as well, which is incompatible with the real-world use case. The previously proposed auto-pred strategy, however, uses only the questions and the model's own predictions to form the conversational history - which seems to be more compatible with the real-world use case.  In summary, it is not clear why the proposed new way of automatically evaluating CQA systems is better or should be adopted as opposed to the previously proposed automated evaluation method of using a model's predictions as the conversational history (auto-pred), and the comparison between the results for these two automated strategies seems to be a missing exploration and discussion. ",
    "comments": "Questions to the authors (which also act as suggestions):  Q1. - Line 151: \"four representative CQA models\" - what does representative mean here? representative in what sense? In terms of types or architectures of models? This needs clarification and takes on importance because the discrepancy, in terms of how models get evaluated on human vs automated evaluation, depends on these four models in a sense.  Q2. Line 196: \"We noticed that the annotators are biased when evaluating the correctness of answers\" - are any statistics on this available?  Q3. Section 3.1: For Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing work, what was the compensation rate for the annotators? This should be mentioned, if not in the main text, then add to appendix and point to it in the main text. Also, following the work in Card et al (2020) (\"With Little Power Comes Great Responsibility.\") - were there any steps taken to ensure the human annotation collection study was appropriately powered? ( If not, consider noting or discussing this somewhere in the paper as it helps with understanding the validity of human experiments) Q4. Lines 264-265: \"The gap between HAM and ExCorD is significant in Auto-Gold\" - how is significance measured here?\nQ5. Lines 360-364: \"We determine whether e∗_j = e_j by checking if F1(s∗_{j,1}, s_{j,1}) > 0 ....  .... as long as their first mentions have word overlap.\" Two questions here -      5a. It is not clear why word overlap was used and not just an exact match here? What about cases where there is some word overlap but the two entities are indeed different, and therefore, the question is invalid (in terms of coreference resolution) but deemed valid? \n    5b. How accurate is this invalid question detection strategy? In case this has not already been measured, perhaps a sample of instances where predicted history invalidates questions via unresolved coreference (marked by humans) can be used to then detect if the automated method catches these instances accurately. Having some idea of how well invalid question detection happens is needed to get a sense of if or how many of the invalid questions will get rewritten.  Comments, suggestions, typos:  - Line 031: \"has the promise to revolutionize\" - this should be substantiated further, seems quite vague.  - Line 048: \"extremely competitive performance of\" - what is 'performance' for these systems? ideally be specific since, at this point in the paper, we do not know what is being measured, and 'extremely competitive' is also quite vague.  - The abstract is written well and invokes intrigue early - could potentially be made even better if, for \"evaluating with gold answers is inconsistent with human evaluation\" - an example of the inconsistency, such as models get ranked differently is also given there.  - Line 033: \"With recent development of large-scale datasets\" -> the* recent development, but more importantly - which languages are these datasets in? And for this overall work on CQA, the language which is focused on should be mentioned early on in the introduction and ideally in the abstract itself.  - Line 147: \"more modeling work has been done than in free-form question answering\" - potential typo, maybe it should be \"maybe more modeling work has been done 'in that'\" - where that refers to extractive QA?\n- Line 222: \"In total, we collected 1,446 human-machine con- versations and 15,059 question-answer pairs\" - suggestion: It could be reasserted here that this dataset will be released as this collection of conversations is an important resource and contribution and does not appear to have been highlighted as much as it could.  - Figure 2: It is a bit unintuitive and confusing to see the two y-axes with different ranges and interpret what it means for the different model evaluations. Can the same ranges on the y-axes be used at least even if the two metrics are different? Perhaps the F1 can use the same range as Accuracy - it would mean much smaller gold bars but hopefully, still get the point across without trying to keep two different ranges in our head? Still, the two measures are different - consider making two side-by-side plots instead if that is feasible instead of both evaluations represented in the same chart.  - Lines 250-252: \"the absolute numbers of human evaluation are much higher than those of automatic evaluations\" - saying this seems a bit suspect - what does absolute accuracy numbers being higher than F1 scores mean? They are two different metrics altogether and should probably not be compared in this manner. Dropping this, the other implications still hold well and get the point across - the different ranking of certain models, and Auto-Gold conveying a gap between two models where Human Eval does not.  - Line 348: \"background 4, S∗ - latex styling suggestion, add footnote marker only right after the punctuation for that renders better with latex, so - \"background,\\footnote{} ...\" in latex.\n- Footnote 4: 'empirically helpful' - should have a cite or something to back that there.  - Related Work section: a suggestion that could make this section but perhaps also the broader work stronger and more interesting to a broader audience is making the connection to how this work fits with other work looking at different NLP tasks that looks at failures of the popular automated evaluation strategy or metrics failing to capture or differing significantly from how humans would evaluate systems in a real-world setting.

    "paper_summary": "This paper presents a knowledge distillation method based on MAML. The paper's main aim is to address two drawbacks of existing knowledge distillation methods: (1) teacher being unaware of the capacity of the student, and (2) teacher not optimised for distillation.\nThe paper assumes the teacher network is trainable and proposes a simple technique that, in the MAML framework, applies \"pilot updates\" in the inner loop to make the teacher and student networks more compatible. Pilot updates are essentially MAML's original inner loop, but applied twice, the first time to update the teacher and the second time to update the student.\nExperiments are performed on distilling BERT and evaluated on a number of tasks/datasets in the GLUE benchmark. The proposed method consistently outperforms the compared baselines on almost all tasks.\nOn the CV side, the proposed method is evaluated on distilling ResNet and VGG. The method achieves comparable performance with SOTA model CRD. ",

",
    "weaknesses": "- The proposed method is quite simple. Its essence is the \"pilot update\" mechanism, which basically applies the inner loop of MAML twice, once to update the teacher, and once to update the student.\n- The achieved performance boost is moderate.\n- The comparative analysis in Table 2 shows that, with significantly more computational costs than the two compared baselines (PKD and ProKT), the model achieves a modest performance gain of about 0.5 absolute F1 points. This analysis, though very welcome, demonstrates that the proposed method suffers a large computational penalty for a small accuracy/F1 gain. ",

    "paper_summary": "The paper is a resubmission of previous work that looked at neutralising framing bias in news stories. The authors here propose a new task called neutral summary generation where the aim is to create an unbiased summary of potentially biased stories covering one event. To measure the bias of the generated summaries, the authors use lexical estimates of polarity which is shown to correlate with relative framing bias. Finally, a new model is proposed that uses titles in addition to article summaries as a way of focusing on the framing used by each side. The results show that the suggested approach is promising but a lot of challenges remain. ",
    "strengths": "- The paper introduces a new task, namely neutral summary generation from multiple biased articles. The new task is more sensible compared to the originally proposed one. Overall the revised paper (and the authors' response) has addressed a lot of the issues in the original submission.\n- The dataset is a useful resource for studying framing bias and multi-view summarisation.\n- The use of polarity as a proxy for framing bias is an interesting research direction. ",

    "comments": "### Main questions/comments Looking at the attached dataset files, I cannot work out whether the data is noisy or if I don't understand the format. The 7th example in the test set has three parts separated by [SEP] which I thought corresponded to the headlines from the three sides (left, center, right). However, the second and third headlines don't make sense as stand-alone texts. Especially the third one which states \"Finally, borrowers will receive relief.\" seems like a continuation of the previous statements.  In addition to the previous question, I cannot find the titles, any meta-information as stated in lines 187-189, nor VAD scores which I assumed would be included.\nPart of the motivation is that scaling the production of neutral (all-sides) summaries is difficult. It would be good to quantify this if possible, as a counterargument to that would be that not all stories are noteworthy enough to require such treatment (and not all stories will appear on all sides).\nAllsides.com sometimes includes more than one source from the same side -- e.g. https://www.allsides.com/story/jan-6-panel-reportedly-finds-gaps-trump-white-house-phone-records has two stories from Center publishers (CNBC and Reuters) and none from the right. Since the inputs are always one from each side (Section 3.2), are such stories filtered out of the dataset?  Of the two major insights that form the basis of this work (polarity is a proxy for framing bias and titles are good indicators of framing bias) only first one is empirically tested with the human evaluation presented in Section 5.1.3. Even then, we are missing any form of analysis of disagreements or low correlation cases that would help solidify the argument. The only evidence we have for the second insight are the results from the NeuS-Title system (compared to the NeuSFT model that doesn't explicitly look at the titles), but again, the comparison is not systematic enough (e.g. no ablation study) to give us concrete evidence to the validity of the claim.\nRelated to the previous point, it's not clear what the case study mentioned in Section 4.2 actually involved. The insights gathered aren't particularly difficult to arrive at by reading the related literature and the examples in Table 1, while indicative of the arguments don't seem causally critical. It would be good to have more details about this study and how it drove the decisions in the rest of the paper. In particular, I would like to know if there were any counterexamples to the main points (e.g. are there titles that aren't representative of the type of bias displayed in the main article?).\nThe example in Table 3 shows that the lexicon-based approach (VAD dataset) suffers from lack of context sensitivity (the word \"close\" in this example is just a marker of proximity). This is a counterpoint to the advantages of such approaches presented in Section 5.1.1 and it would be interesting to quantify it (e.g. by looking at the human-annotated data from Section 5.1.3) beyond the safeguard introduced in the second paragraph (metric calibration).\nFor the NeuS-Title model, does that order of the input matter? It would be interesting to rerun the same evaluation with different permutations (e.g. center first, or right first). Is there a risk of running into the token limit of the encoder?\nFrom the examples shared in Table 3, it appears that both the NeuSFT and NeuS-Title models stay close to a single target article. What strikes me as odd is that neither chose the center headline (the former is basically copying the Right headline, the latter has done some paraphrasing both mostly based on the Left headline). Is there a particular reason for this? Is the training objective discouraging true multi-headline summarisation since the partisan headlines will always contain more biased information/tokens?\n### Minor issues I was slightly confused by the word \"headline\" to refer to the summary of the article. I think of headlines and titles as fundamentally the same thing: short (one sentence) high-level descriptions of the article to come. It would be helpful to refer to longer text as a summary or a \"headline roundup\" as allsides.com calls it. Also there is a discrepancy between the input to the NeuS-Title model (lines 479-486) and the output shown in Table 3 (HEADLINE vs ARTICLE).\nSome citations have issues. Allsides.com is cited as (all, 2021) and (Sides, 2018); the year is missing for the citations on lines 110 and 369; Entman (1993) and (2002) are seemingly the same citation (and the 1993 is missing any publication details); various capitatlisation errors (e.g. \"us\" instead of \"US\" on line 716) It's not clear what the highlighting in Table 1 shows (it is implicitly mentioned later in the text). I would recommend colour-coding the different types of bias and providing the details in the caption. ",

First of all, will the author release the dataset or will it remain private? \nAre the guidelines used to train the annotators publicly available? \nHaving a single person responsible for the check at the end of the first round may introduce biases. A better practice would be to have more than one checker for each problem, at least on a subset of the corpus, to measure the agreement between them and, in case of need, adjust the guidelines. \nIt is not clear how many problems are examined during the second round and the agreement between the authors is not reported. \nIt is not clear what is meant by \"accuracy\" during the annotation stages.\n3) Additional metrics that may be used to evaluate text generation: METEOR (http://dx.doi.org/10.3115/v1/W14-3348), SIM(ile) (http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/P19-1427).\n4) Why have the authors decided to use the colon symbol rather than a more original and less common symbol? Since the colon has usually a different meaning in natural language, do they think it may have an impact?\n5) How much are these problems language-dependent? Meaning, if these problems were perfectly translated into another language, would they remain valid? What about the R4 category? Additional comments about these aspects would be beneficial for future works, cross-lingual transfers, and multi-lingual settings.\n6) In Table 3, it is not clear whether the line with +epsilon refers to the human performance when the gold explanation is available or to the roberta performance when the golden explanation is available? \nIn any case, both of these two settings would be interesting to know, so I suggest, if it is possible, to include them in the comparison if it is possible.\n7) The explanation that must be generated for the query, the correct answer, and the incorrect answers could be slightly different. Indeed, if I am not making a mistake, the explanation for the incorrect answer must highlight the differences w.r.t. the query, while the explanation for the answer must highlight the similarity. It would be interesting to analyze these three categories separately and see whether if there are differences in the models' performances. ",

Comparison with prior works shows some improvement while ablation studies indicate that alignment of entity and relation embeddings contributes to performance. ",

    "paper_summary": "*(minor edits from previous review XYZ)* Text style transfer is the task of rewriting a sentence into a target style while approximately preserving its content. Modern style transfer research operates in an \"unsupervised\" setting, where no parallel training data (pairs of sentences differing in style) is available, but assume access to a large unpaired corpus in each style.\nThis paper argues that a large unpaired corpus to train style transfer systems might be hard to obtain in practice, especially in certain domains. To tackle this issue, the authors present a new meta-learning approach (DAML) which trains a style transfer system that can quickly adapt to unseen domains during inference (with a few unpaired examples). The authors build their style transfer system using a discriminative learning objective (via a style classifier) while fine-tuning T5, which they call ST5. The authors approach DAML-ST5 outperforms several baselines on sentiment transfer and Shakespeare author imitiation, and ablation studies confirm the design decisions. ",
    "strengths": "*(identical to my previous review GAJd, see \"Weaknesses\" for my response to the revised manuscript)* 1. This paper tackles a practically relevant problem. While current style transfer research does not leverage supervised data, it requires a large amount of unpaired data which may not be practical to obtain in low-resource languages or domains. Hence, building style transfer systems which can quickly adapt in low-resource settings is important, since it eliminates the expensive requirement of hand-curating unpaired datasets for each low-resource domain / language.\n2. The paper presents an interesting method based on model-agnostic meta learning [1] (with modifications to make it suitable for domain adaptation) to learn a good initialization which works well across domains. During inference, the model can quickly adapt to a new domain, with decent performance with just 1% of the target domain data. Experimental results confirm the proposed approach outperforms several strong baselines. The paper also has ablation studies to justify the various design decisions used in the approach.\n[1] - https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400 ",

I guess these can affect the results.\n- The nonlinear transformations in the neural works, such as $exp$ and $tanh$ have not been considered in the theoretical derivations.

The authors focus on the NLP domain and compare the performance of this method with the previously used visual Taskonomy method (Saaty, 1987, Zamir et al., 2018). They find that their method performs better than random and that it provides taxonomy results that seem intuitive. While the method doesn't provide performance as high as the one in Zamir et al. (2018), it requires less compute and might therefore function as a potential alternative. ",
    "strengths": "The authors take an influential taxonomy idea from the visual domain and explore it in the domain of NLP. The learned taxonomy is based on cognitive data, providing an interesting approach to the task. ",
    "weaknesses": "In my view, the paper would benefit from refocusing on exploring its main contributions. First of all, the abstract states that the method results in \"competitive [performance] to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, 1987) used in visual Taskonomy (Zamir et al., 2018)\". When inspecting the results, the performance is better than random but still far from the performance of the AHP method. The core contribution, therefore, seems to be that their method doesn't require expensive transfer learning between tasks. This point should be highlighted and explained further: Where does this become especially relevant and to what extent does it matter? The authors write that more advantages over AHP will be shown later (line 533ff) but it remains unclear to me when and where we will learn about those.\nSecondly although the CogTaskonomy framework is introduced as a combination of two separate methods, there is no analysis how important their combination is. CRA seems to be more important than CNM and in combination with the BERT model, their combination barely matters. Is there an intuition why one would be more important than the other? Similarly, a comparison of which cognitive data is used might be interesting as well (i.e., fMRI vs. eyetracking data, for instance).\nFinally, the taxonomy itself could be an interesting contribution but its exploration remains very limited. The authors visualize the taxonomy learned by one component of the CogTaskonomy framework (CNM) which also seems intuitive (Figure 4). However, it remains unexplored whether this is the same for all tested methods or even just what it would be for the complete CogTaskonomy framework.\nOverall, I found the paper slightly difficult to follow. Making the contribution more pronounced and how this specifically connects to the results and future opportunities might help with this. A more direct method comparison with respect to data needed, training pipeline and other important points of distinction would have also helped me. There were also a couple of conclusions that didn't follow for me from the data which I'll specify in the comments and suggestions. ",

Is there a way to make this more intuitive?\n*General comments:* In the contributions (line 110), the authors state that the \"CNM is able to learn stable task relations\" (line 128f). However, this is only one of two components of the the proposed CogTaskonomy framework. What about the CRA?\nThe phrase \"sentence-level textual stimuli of cognitive data\" (e.g., line 259f) is very obscure. I recommend expanding on it once to clarify.\nI didn't understand the paragraph 4.1 Cognitive Dataset. Specifically, it's not intuitive to me why the voxels had to be randomly selected (line 400f).\nI think it would be useful to mention to the reader that high scores are undesirable in the TRS metric (e.g., Table 1 and Figure 3).\nThe authors try to make an argument across architectures but only based on BERT architectures which seems a weak generalizability claim. I would suggest either weakening the phrasing or providing more models.\n*Typos:*  - abstract: CogTaxonomy -> CogTaskonomy - line 83f: clarify that these terms are introduced by the authors and are not pre-existing parts - line 265: concepts - line 557: more robust ",

I am pleased to see the improvements the authors have made in reorganizing the paper, adding experimental results and analyses, etc. Nearly all of the concerns I and other reviewers raised were addressed. Therefore, I decide to raise the assessment score from the previous 3.5 to 4.\nThe contribution (or novelty) of this paper is convincing to me personally. In my opinion, the central contribution is the application of NMN to delicately deconstruct complex questions, rather than simply introducing NMNs. Moreover, the authors conduct a comprehensive experiment. The results are plausible given the authors’ explanations.\nIn addition, there are some minor concerns that could be addressed to further enhance this work: 1. \tThe experiment for inference time comparison should be added. \n2. \tMore detailed analysis of the cascading errors is necessary. \n3. \tThere exist more complex question types, e.g., compare, count. It would be valuable to explore the scalability of this work for these complex question types. ",

On the one hand, conversational question answering (CQA) has been a challenging problem in language understanding and of many applications. On the other hand, speech modality in a natural form for conversation and contains additional information in audio signals. It is natural to explore the intersection of the two, i.e., SCQA. There are several existing works, but the research is usually limited by available dataset. This paper collects a Spoken-CoQA dataset based on CoQA and Google TTS for generating the training set and human speakers for collecting the test set audio. The authors also proposed DDNET approach which is a unification of knowledge distillation and dual attention techniques, and showed the efficacy of DDNET empirically by applying DDNET to various spoken QA models.

If the dataset is released as the authors promised, it will signifcantly benefit the research and benchmarking in SCQA problem.\n- The authors proposed a novel approach, DDNET. The approach leverages knowledge distillation and dual attention techniques to combine text representation and audio representation. The authors further showed the efficacy of DDNET empirically by applying DDNET to various spoken QA models and benchmarking with Spoken-CoQA dataset and a public available spoken SQuAD dataset. ",

It would be great if the authors can provide some qualitiative analysis to help readers understanding the quality of result. Also, it would be interesting to see how the audio modality helps the answer prediction to better interpret the pros and cons of proposed method and the addition of audio modality.\n- There is a recent trend to bypass ASR, in order to make the underlying methods more scalable to low resourced languages. The proposed method still relies on ASR and it would be interesting to see if SCQA can achieve reasonable performance without ASR system. ",

NLU++ is intended to be challenging to state-of-the-art ToD systems and emphasizes sample quality over quantity. It includes two domains (\"Hotel\" and \"Bank\"), with 1k and 2k samples, respectively.\nThe authors perform a series of intent detection (ID) and slot labeling (SL) experiments based on this new resource, with a particular focus on low-resource settings. For intent detection, MLP classifiers are compared with models based on the question answering (QA) paradigm. The presented findings demonstrate that QA models generally outperform MLP models on the ID task, achieving F1 scores of up to 93 points. SL proves to be more challenging, with the evaluated models obtaining F1 scores of up to 72 points. Unsurprisingly, F1 is substantially lower in the low-resource setting for both tasks. The authors also demonstrate that generic intents transfer across domains, with ID models trained on the one of the two domains being able to detect generic intents in the other domain with substantial accuracy. ",

",

I’ve updated a summary of weaknesses to reflect the updates, and have listed a few suggestions on grammar.*\nThis work presents a method (X-GEAR) for zero-shot, cross-lingual event argument extraction. X-GEAR takes as input i) a passage, ii) a trigger word (a predicate, e.g., \"killed\"), and iii) a template indicating the desired roles (e.g., <Victim>NONE</Victim>). The output is the template filled with event arguments extracted from the passage (e.g., NONE might be replaced with civilian). X-GEAR is built using the standard Seq2seq framework with a copy mechanism, where the input is composed of the triplet (passage, template, trigger word) flattened as a sequence, and the output is the template filled with desired roles.\nThe method relies on recent advances in large, multilingual pre-trained language models (PTLM) such as MT5, which have been shown to perform robust cross-lingual reasoning. The key insight of the method is to use language-agnostic special tokens (e.g., <Victim>) for the template. Fine-tuning on the source language helps learn meaningful representations for templates, which allows their approach to work across target languages supported by the PTLM. ",

And if so, does this actually generalize to a more typical setting, which uses fixed length multiple sentence inputs? If you are making a significant change, justifying it verbally is not as good as testing the effect of it.\nThe authors describe the Transformer performance as evidence that \"Transformer encoders exhibit surprisingly good transferability to other languages\". I disagree with this characterization. It looks from the plot as though the random weights have much better performance in the Transformer model, indicating that the Transformer is not necessarily transferring the data better, but is just better at learning the fine tuned task generally.

During evaluation, the paper pre-trains LMs with causal language modeling objective on the synthesized languages and evaluate its perplexity on natural language data, and reaches a series of interesting observations about LSTM and Transformer on these languages with different linguistic features. For LMs with masked language modeling objective, downstream tasks such as POS tagging and dependency parsing are also considered.  The main takeaway is that LMs benefit the most from a nested structure from the synthesized language, with an especially strong downstream performance. ",
    "strengths": "- The paper tackles the fascinating question of how LMs are able to transfer cross-lingually. Specifically, readers like myself who are aware that LMs _can_ transfer from L1 to L2 without the same alphabets, are interested in knowing _how_.  - The proposed approach of using a synthesized language as L1 is creative and reasonable. While the idea stems from (Papadimitriou and and Jurafsky, 2020), I still applaud the novelty, especially with a suite of improvements and additions to the method.  - The experiments seem sound.  - The observations are informed and faithful to the results, and are clearly presented.  - The paper is very well written. For a reader who is no expert on such line of probing work, it is very easy to follow. ",
    "weaknesses": "- In Section 3.2.3, I struggle to understand the intuition and motivation behind the head-to-tail method. How does the fact that two tokens (i.e. \"<xyz\" and \"xyz>\") always appear in the same sentence help create a dependency relation? While the method seems to stem from Papadimitriou and Jurafsky (2020), it's desirable to explain a bit more for self-containment.  - In Section 3.2.2, I would appreciate more intuition behind the \"Random walk\" language. Mathematically (for someone who is not an expert on linear algebra), why would the dot product between a \"topic vector\" and a \"word vector\" give rise to \"non-trivial cooccurrence\"?  - I'd like to know why the authors perform different experiments on language models with CLM (causal) and MLM (masked) objectives. Specifically, why not also calculate perplexity of an MLM encoder on an NL L2? Why not also run the CLM encoder on some downstream tasks?  - For the CLM experiments, is it widely believed that perplexity is a faithful metric to evaluate \"performance\" of the encoder in question?\n- In Section 5.2, it's confusing to choose POS tagging as a downstream task, and then neglect it in the analysis because \"PoS tagging seems to require little structural knowledge on language\". I would appreciate a bit more discussion here. Does the linguistic features studied help with POS, or not? What is the purpose of reporting the POS experiment?\n- Circling back to the motivation of this work, which is the fact that \"an encoder only pretrained on L1 can be transferred to L2 without any parameter updates\". I wonder in what downstream tasks the said encoder transferred to? Are there any higher-level tasks such as NLI, QA, SRL, etc.? Would you consider other downstream tasks than dependency parsing? ",

The flexibility of the Transformer is not a convincing explanation -- if the closeness between L1 and L2 is not a good indicator of transfer performance, then how do we conclude that a synthetic language L1 is helpful because it is closer to a real language L2? \n5) In figure 3(b), why does uniform token sampling is worse than random weights by so much?\n- There some technical mistakes. \n1) The method of sentence-dependent token sampling can not be called \"random work\".

Since RoBERTa is generally considered more powerful than LSTM and MLP, it is likely that the high performance largely results from RoBERTa rather than the trainable SR strategy itself. Then the comparison between the setting with and without SR may be unfair. Also, it is questionable whether it is worth the much larger computation resources to use a RoBERTa-based SR module instead of the simple and effective PRR.  3.

    "paper_summary": "Automated evaluation of coherence in a conversation is a longstanding challenge in conversational models. Recent models address the task using contrastive learning where the goal is to learn a classifier to distinguish between a coherent conversation and an incoherent one. However, the problem of existing models lies in heuristic manipulations that result in unrealistic and too easy negative examples.\nThe paper presents a method, namely DEAM, to overcome the problem of constructing more realistic negative examples. To this end, the proposed method (a) converts an utterance to an AMR graph, a semantic representation that abstracts away from syntax, (b) injects inconsistency to AMR, (c) translates the manipulated AMR back to text. The effectiveness of DEAM rests on determining ways to manipulate AMRs—i.e., step (b). This is done via four logical flaws that dialogue models mainly suffer from: contradiction, coreference inconsistency, irrelevancy, and engagement decline.\nDEAM is compared against other seemingly trivial baselines that shuffle utterances, shuffle one speaker’s utterances, or insert random utterances. Under the same setting, DEAM outperforms all existing baselines in terms of correlation with human judgment. Also, via an ablation study, decreased engagement and irrelevancy are shown to be the most impactful issues. ",
    "strengths": "- Evaluating conversational models automatically is notoriously cumbersome. The proposed method in the paper aims at gauging coherence in conversations, which is important in building natural-sounding dialogue systems.\n- The proposed perturbations in AMR seem to be easy for the community to use for their own datasets.  - The analysis of the proposed paper is convincing; especially the correlation with the human judgment that is shown to be consistently the highest among the three baselines.\nOverall, I think the paper is a nice contribution and can be of interest to the community. ",
    "weaknesses": "- The four logical flaws in dialogue systems are derived from “the observation of interactions between advanced dialogue systems and humans” (L272-273). More information about these observations is helpful. For instance, in which dialogue models these observations were made? How often do they occur? Are there other flaws too? The last question can be important for future research.\n- The paper can also benefit from an error analysis. What are the circumstances that DEAM fails? To what extent does failure in AMR parsing cause an issue in DEAM?\n- The AMR abstraction from syntax may attribute to inadvertent inconsistencies. In Figure 4 top-right, I can see that the verb tense is changed from past to present. In this particular example, this may not be much of an issue, but for some cases, this can lead to unintended inconsistency. For example, if the conversation is about a deceased person, past tense is presumably used frequently and only a tense change to present can make the conversation flawed. ",

However, It is not very helpful to compare with such naive adaptions, in my opinion. For example, one can intelligently adapt the GROUP-DRO algorithm to multi-label classification by considering multiple weights(one for each label) for each group instead of a single weight and adapting the weights based on the corresponding label binary cross-entropy loss. By assigning multiple weights, we can still assign higher weightage to minority classes rather than considering the average losses in the group.\n4.

    "paper_summary": "The paper proposes a multi-task knowledge distillation framework for unsupervised cross-lingual NER applications. This framework consists of two teacher training models as two tasks, i.e., Entity recognizer teacher and similarity evaluator teacher for entity recognition and token type identification, respectively in the source language. Similarity evaluator teacher model is based on siamese neural network. It is trained as a similarity prediction task with two uniformly sampled tokens from two input sentences. The input sentences are randomly selected from the input dataset. Then a Teacher Student Distillation model is simultaneously trained with both teachers’ soft labels to improve the representation for the target language. For student model training, the loss is constructed as weighted supervisory singles from different teacher models.  The experiments are conducted on three datasets and six low-resource languages. The model performance is compared with several existing baselines. To understand the insights of the model, an ablation study, case study, and other analyses were conducted. ",

Where (w2, w5) and (w2, w6) are considered as token pairs by Similarity teachers. The English NER model predicts correct labels Lc for w2 and incorrect label Lic for w5 and w6. While training with the student model, it is possible that the similarity evaluator teacher may provide incorrect supervision for w2 as the other two tokens have incorrect labels. \n2.

    "paper_summary": "The paper presents a method for representing the relevance of a linguistic dataset to the corresponding language and its speakers. As a proxy for speakers of a certain language the authors use geographical entities, particularly countries. The representation they aim to build relies on entity linking, so the authors explore this problem on several multilingual datasets, and draw conclusions regarding the cross-lingual consistency of NER and EL systems. ",
    "strengths": "The paper addresses an important problem, that gives a new way of assessing the representativeness of a dataset for a specific language. Since such text collections are at the basis of every other language task, and provide language models on which much of the higher level processing is based, it is important to have collections that are representative for the language (and speakers) that are targeted. ",
    "weaknesses": "While the main idea of the paper is valuable and interesting, and thoroughly explored, it is based on some assumptions whose soundness is debatable. Details are in the comments section.\n- there is a disconnect between the visualizations and the rest of the processing.\n- the preprocessing of the datasets (many for low-resource languages) needs resources that are themselves scarce, incomplete, or borrowed from other languages (that may use other scripts, and hence there is a transliteration problem on top of others). This makes the kind of processing presented here a bit unrealistic, in the sense that it could not be deployed on any collected dataset, and give an objective view of the representativeness of that dataset for the corresponding language (this is linked to the first point, and explanations are below) - some information in the data is discarded (topical adjectives, historical entities), and it is not clear what impact using it would have on the final geographical mapping. ",
    "comments": "With regards to the disconnect between the visualizations and the rest of the processing: the visualizations are based on geographical statistics for entities in a text, but these entities are already marked. It would have been useful to see how an end-to-end process performs: apply NER on the NER and QA datasets, and build the same visualizations as in section 3. How do the visualization using imperfect NER/EL resources and processing tools compare to the visualizations obtained on the annotated data? Are they very far apart, or the underlying \"character\" of the dataset is still retrievable even in such imperfect conditions? This links to the second potential weakness, regarding the applicability of this method to newly collected datasets (which is the aim, right?).  The geographical mapping presented is left to the subjective inspection of a human judge. Which is not necessarily bad in itself, but as the more detailed maps in the appendix show, the characteristics of some datasets are very very similar (e.g. for European countries for example, or other geographically close countries). It may be useful to have a more rigorous evaluation of the geographical mapping, by showing that from the geographical distribution of entities, one can predict the country corresponding to the dataset's language. This could be done in an unsupervised manner, or using a linear regression model, or something similarly simple -- maybe by deducting an \"average\" entity geographical distribution model, such that local characteristics become more prominent, or by computing (in an unsupervised manner) some weights that would downplay the contribution of entities from countries that are always represented (like a \"country tfidf\" maybe?).  Some geographical indicators are disregarded, and that may have an impact on the visualizations. Annotating topical adjectives that indicate countries seems doable, based on the anchor texts of links pointing to countries, which are easy to obtain (for some languages). The same for some of the historical entities that no longer exist, but some of which have corresponding GPS coordinates that could be used. The point is that both the resources and the process used to build the geographical maps of the datasets are incomplete. Some are by necessity (because the available resources are incomplete), some by choice (the adjectives and historical figures). We need to know the impact of such processing constraints.\nIt is interesting to analyze the correlation between socio-economic factors, but how does that impact the construction or characteristics of the datasets? Some of these factors -- e.g. the GDP, -- could be (in this experiment) a proxy for the level of web presence of the population, and the level of information digitization of that particular population. Maybe some parameters that measure these issues more explicitly -- which seem more closely relevant to the process of textual collection building -- would provide better insights into data characteristics.\nUsing a country as a proxy for language is useful, but it may skew the data representation, as the authors themselves recognize. What happens with languages that occupy the same country-level geographical space, but are distinct, as happens with multi-lingual countries? The same with languages that cross many borders. A bit more insight into how these are reflected in dataset characteristics and how they impact the usefulness of the dataset would be very useful.\nWhy does the cross-language consistency matter here? Each dataset (for the geographical mapping) is analyzed separately, so while cross-lingual consistency is indeed a problem, it is not clear how it is related to the problem of dataset mapping. Is the cross-lingual consistency a signal of something other than the general performance of NER/EL systems?

The paper makes the claim that the most obvious way to do knowledge distillation with seq2seq models (just using the generated output from the teacher model as a target output for the student; also called pseudo-labeling), is problematic. The problems with pseudo-labeling relate to known but important to restate problems with current abstractive summarization models in general: they generally copy from the target document, and they generally only copy the leading line of the target document. The paper attributes the causes for both of these problems being at least in part due to the attention distribution for the teacher models being too sharp, often focusing most of its weight on the next available word. In order to counteract these effects, the paper proposes to raise the temperature for the attention soft max in order to smooth the attention distribution of the teacher model. The temperature scaling modifications are evaluated on three standard datasets (CNN/DM, XSum, and NYT), with slight improvements in distillation performance found across all three datasets. ",

I think if this paper couched itself as more of a 'analysis/experimental' type of paper, expanding its analysis even further (and maybe expanding its scope to other tasks besides just abstractive summarization), it could be solid contribution. Unfortunately, the paper is presented more as a 'methods' paper, with the new method being proposed simply being a change in hyperparameters. ",

In other words, the cross lingual summarization is the combination of machine translation and summarization.\nSome previous studies regarded the cross lingual summarization as the combination task of machine translation and summarization, and proposed multi-task learning methods. \nIn contrast, this study regards the cross lingual summarization as a super-task of machine translation and summarization, and proposes a hierarchical model to control them. The proposed method uses two kinds of latent variables: global and local. A global corresponds to cross lingual summarization, and a local corresponds to machine translation and summarization. This paper applies conditional variational auto encoder to treat these latent variables.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieved better performance than previous methods in automatic and human evaluation.

The proposed method share parameters of an encoder but this paper does not explain other methods explicitly. Thus, I cannot judge whether the proposed training strategy improves the performance or sharing parameters improves the performance (or other reasons for improvements). \nI recommend explaining the number of sentences and parameter sizes for each method explicitly.\nMoreover, I suppose that the proposed method requires much more training time than previous methods. If so, the authors should discuss the relation between training time and performance because a view on Green AI is important.\nFor the human evaluation, the authors used only 25 samples but the number of samples are too small.

    "paper_summary": "This paper first stipulates desirable properties for metrics measuring the performance of multi-label classification systems where the label set has a hierarchical structure. Then it introduces the Information Contrast Model (ICM) and compares it with other metrics which are commonly used in the literature to evaluate multi-label classification.  It is argued ICM satisfies more of the desirable properties than others.\nThe paper presents two experiments using synthetic and real-world text classification datasets. The synthetic data experiment results shows ICM distinguished better class assignments from worse assignments robustly for various types of differences. The real-world data experiment shows ICM ranked tested classifiers similar to the existing metrics but penalizes them differently. ",
    "strengths": "1. The paper made explicit desirable properties of an evaluation metric for hierarchical multi-label classification tasks, and analyzed existing and proposed metrics using the concepts. I think it is an important contribution for metric research, which often ends up in a competition for better correlations to another “golden” metric. The formulation can facilitate in-depth discussions based on metric aspects and allow metric users to choose one based on their demands. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. I cannot fully understand the settings for the synthetic data experiments, thus cannot be sure what kind of evidence these experiments provide. \n    * For the “Sensitivity to Error Rate” test, the authors wrote “we randomly remove selected (i, c) assignments” but didn’t explain how they selected. They might mean removing assignments with a probability X but I cannot tell for sure if my understanding is correct from the statement. \n    * For the “Hierarchical Similarity” test, the authors mentioned “single labeled items with leaf categories”, which implies there are items with non-leaf categories. But non-leaf categories never seemed to be assigned when  generating the synthesized datasets. I’m confused. \n    * For the “Item Specificity” test, the authors wrote “For the worst output, we randomly select an item i, and we take one if its assignments (i, c).” The “if” clause looks unfinished and I cannot guess what was, probably unintentionally, dropped.\n2. I cannot see what kind of new values ICM will have practically for selecting and/or designing multi-label classifiers. The real-world data experiment showed ICM’s ranking is aligned with some other existing metrics. It is argued that ICM penalizes some classifiers differently after score normalization. But the normalization seems to depend on absolute scores of compared classifiers thus the penalty statement may not hold when more classifiers are added to comparison. ",

    "paper_summary": "This work proposes to frame the task of controlled text generation as sampling from a combination of black-box models that are responsible for various components of interest such as fluency, the controlled attribute, and relevance to the prompt. Pre-trained black-box experts provide scores for each of these desired components that are linearly combined to form an \"energy-based\" model, from which samples can be drawn without needing any task-specific training. Experiments are conducted on several tasks such as controllable debiasing, sentiment and formality transfer and prompted generation, and results show that this method outperforms task-specific baselines. ",
    "strengths": "1. Paper is well-written and easy to follow. \n2. The idea of having a modular controlled text generation model that uses blackbox components is interesting and novel. The approach can be adapted to any desired components or metrics by using the appropriate pre-trained expert models, and does not need any additional task-specific training. \n3. Several experiments are conducted to show that their model outperforms task-specific baselines on multiple tasks. Ablation results are also shown which help assess the contributions of each component. \n4. Human evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the superior quality of the generated text. Some limitations of the model are also briefly discussed. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. One of the main drawbacks of this approach is that presumably the different component black-box experts of the controlled text generation have to be manually selected and the weighted linear combination has to be fine-tuned for each task. It is also not discussed if the inference time is significantly affected by this approach. \n2. For the sentiment transfer task, the model with the higher Hamming distance coefficient is considered to be the best model based on the BertScore with respect to the source, which essentially measures how much deviation has been introduced. It appears however that the model with the higher Discriminator coefficient is better, in terms of perplexity and the internal/external classifiers. Given that the Hamming distance in the reference is much higher, it may not be necessary to absolutely reduce the number of changes made, if it serves the overall purpose of the text generation to make more changes. This is somewhat true for the formality transfer task as well. \n3. In Table 3, for the formality transfer task, the method sees a decline in performance for the ->Informal task. While the improvement in the ->Formal task is probably a decent tradeoff, this issue is not addressed at all. \n4. Percentage preference through majority voting is reported for the human evaluation. More robust correlation/agreement metrics such as Cohen's Kappa should be reported for reliability. ",

A discussion of these works and comparisons would really strengthen the paper greatly.

Table 6 and 7 start this. It'd be informative to see some of the baselines varied slightly on a plot similar to Mai et al. 2020 or Montero et al 2021 for this task where self-BLEU/ref-BLEU is on one axis and accuracy via the classifier is on the other and things are plotted (top right being better).\nA task such as toxicity via RealToxicityPrompts could be quite interesting and offer a test-bed for comparison against some of the other prior work.\nI'd be interested in seeing how this method extends to other models, i.e. an auto-regressive model such as GPT-2. Is it simply extendible? How well would it do?\nThis is a paper on controllable text generation and a method for this. A discussion of the potential broader impact is missing.

    "paper_summary": "This paper focuses on the privacy concerns of large language models specifically the identification of speaker attributes from the hidden states of GPT-2. This work attempts to demonstrate that privacy concerns exist by a simple attacker network that identifies persona attributes and proposes defense objectives that reduce the exploitation of the model's hidden state. With learning objectives that minimize mutual information and reduce over-learning, this work demonstrates that defense objectives satisfactorily defend against the proposed attacker network.\nProblem Large language models are ubiquitous in application and particularly useful when constructing chatbots. Figure 1 shows that the learned representations of utterance can manifest sensitive information about the persona. The authors also show that with no access to the model, just the final sequence hidden state, simple attacker architectures (MLP) can infer personas from utterances with 37.59% accuracy over 4332 personas. In order to address this, the authors propose two additional learning objectives with an adversarial attacker network. From the perspective of social chatbots, no existing chatbot dataset for private persona information exists. The authors contribute a derivative dataset from PersonaChat that aligns private attributes to the respective personas.\nTheir contributions are as follows - Analyzing persona identification and understanding as a privacy risk - Defensive training loss - Experiments that validate the defense and shows no informativity loss i.e downstream capabilities.\nNote, the defense is across the utterance embeddings which are inherently richer than output token sequences. A defense on sequence embeddings, i.e contextual embeddings in GPT, should constitute effective defense at the token sequence level.\nThe authors use a pre-trained version of GPT-2, DialogGPT, as the initial set of model weights and fine-tune DialogGPT with the PersonaChat dataset. The authors fine-tune their model with three combined losses: Language modeling CE loss, KL loss over the persona distribution predicted by the attacker, and a MI adversarial loss that learns to maximize the attackers classification accuracy which in turn forces the model to incur a defense loss. The KL loss seems to flatten the over-learning problem in CE fine-tuning and the MI loss makes the network private by leveraging a MLP to remove statistical co-occurences in the embeddings related to personas. The overall loss is computed as a weighted sum.\nExperiments The authors gather a persona aligned utterance dataset from Dialogue NLI and PersonaChat. They train a 2 layer MLP attacker model using the sequence embedding as input. The metrics used to evaluate their model is Bayesian Privacy, Bert-score, Top-k, BLEU, PPL, and Distinct.\nTables Table 2 illustrates that traditional LM has a glaring over-learning issue that captures the personas of speakers. This reaffirms the authors motivations. Best guess and random are anticipated to be quite low. The KL portion of the loss in LM+KL variants show that the accuracy is decreased by the regularization effect of the KL loss which is quantified by the max-ratio score (the ratio of most predicted to all predictions). We see that MI adversarial loss forces the model to change output so that the MLP cannot guess persona attributes (reduces accuracy), but does so by making the optimal performance similar to the best guess in that the max ratio jumps significantly and predominately predicts a few persona attributes (my favorite color is blue). The LM+MI variants are likely sufficiently private from my understanding, but reveals attributes/personas that are not relevant; this is of concern in smaller persona datasets. The authors point this out which is very important i.e can fixing privacy open other threat surfaces for other persona applications. This problem emphasizes why KL loss is particularly useful. The authors show that the best model is one that achieves low accuracy on the person prediction task and achieves, secondly, the lowest max-ratio score.\nTable 3 Shows that the scores across a variety of metrics are relatively unchanged for the defensed models to the original LM. We see an increase in PPL indicating that the CE encoding requires more bits but with no change to performance metrics. The PPL increase was explained by the authors as possibly stemming from the noisy nature of the KL loss with respect to the persona predictors task; the attacker model does not want a uniform model. The authors additionally use BERTScore to evaluate the similarity in embedding space, BLEU to check similarity of unigram and bigrams, and Dist to check the distinct unigram and bigrams.  Table 4 shows that the performance across unseen persona labels. This is an important evaluation because the training defense mechanism is significantly more useful if it does not require all personas present for training. We see that performance is pretty similar even when the defender is not allowed to see some of the personas. The subset of personas that are unseen are still significantly below the original language model. From my intuition, this means that the defense objective robustly defends against the attacker model regardless of persona. This invites a conversation about increasingly capable attackers.\nFinally the authors conclude with a qualitative probe of persona predictions and visually demonstrate the output we see in high max-ratio scores; the repetition of the a particular persona/attribute \"my favorite color is blue\". This is intriguing because it shows that the attacking model has focused on some features that lead to an (sub)-optimal result, namely, \"my favorite color is blue\" persona/attribute. This result shows that the attacking model is no longer capable of probing the embeddings; however a more complex model might still be able to represent the GPT-2 parameterized defensed embeddings.\nIn summary it appears that the defense strategies work with little affect to the evaluated metrics. Various downstream applications of the defensed embeddings with compatible performance to traditional LM embeddings would concretely prove that there is little utility degradation, thus expanding on the evaluated metrics; this is largely out of the scope of the paper but would solidify its results. Additionally, expanding the attacker model to more complex neural networks is a worthwhile practical application for the proposed loss functions. ",
    "strengths": "- Privacy oriented dataset with personas - Interesting application of KL loss and MI adversarial losses - Experiments that demonstrate success of loss objectives The paper demonstrates a useful methodology for defending against NN-based persona attacks. The empirical results demonstrates that the proposed approach works for that particular neural network and specifically was not dependent on personas existing in training data. ",
    "weaknesses": "This paper does not have any glaring concerns in my opinion.\nWeaknesses - It is not clear if the defense success is depending on the neural architecture specifically the solutions the network is capable of representing. Are alternative networks, capable of representing higher order functions, still capable of exploiting the defensed embedding? In other words, is the robustness of your approach dependent on the representational capacity of attacker?\n- The approach was applied to a sequence level representation defined in the end of text token in GPT-2. Is it conceivable that the attacker could still attack the individual token level representations? A defense of these token representations would necessitate larger changes to the underlying DialogGPT model. ",

    "paper_summary": "Masked language models suffer from 2 big problems:  Overthinking - too much processing may hinder results for some instances. \nLong inference times - due to high rate of queries and amount of computation needed. \nTo address these issues, adaptive inference has been suggested. In adaptive inference, classification layers are added to intermediate layers of the model. During inference, the model may choose to perform early exit, and make a prediction on a specific sample  without utilizing all of it’s processing power (i.e. all transformer blocks). \nWhether or not the model makes an early prediction is based on hyperparameters and architecture specific details. \nUsing this approach helps deal with both issues at once. It prevents some samples from being over-processed, and allows the model to make a prediction before overfitting, and also speeds up inference, as many samples do not reach the final layer for a prediction.\nIn this work, the authors suggest a new way of deciding whether to perform early exit. This is a combination of 2 previous approaches which exploit the classifier’s output (as a confidence measure) and the agreement between previous classifiers. Each method has its advantages and drawbacks: Exiting based on a confidence threshold is dependent on a single layer’s output, making it prone to noisy decisions. However it is easy to control the model’s speed-accuracy tradeoff  in real time  by adjusting the confidence threshold. Exiting based on classifier consensus is not as easily adjustable, but provides more stable results. By combining the two methods, the writers utilize the advantages of each method while avoiding their flaws. \n  They define some threshold which determines whether a classifier is confident of it’s prediction. Additionally, they define a patience counter which counts how many consecutive classification layers have been confident in their prediction (based on the previous definition). The proposed model will perform an early exit based on layer K’s prediction if layer K is confident, and the patient counter is above a predetermined limit. \nThis allows for robustness while still providing an easy real time control of the speed-accuracy tradeoff, and achieves SOTA results on most of the GLUE benchmark tasks. ",
    "strengths": "This paper’s topic is practical and can benefit both research and industrial usages.  Progressing on previous works, utilizing their strengths and overcoming drawbacks.\nImprovements to SOTA maintained through various tasks and benchmarks.  Interesting ablation studies, strengthening the main claim of the paper.  applicable to other DL tasks. ",
    "weaknesses": "The paper is missing some implementation details. How many tests were run? Are the results an average of a few runs? If so, what is the STD of these results? How many epochs of training?  A similar but not identical issue: There is no mention of the computational budget\\cost in this article.  A natural question to ask is how PCEE-BERT compares to a model that requires both patience and confidence, for which the patience would also be defined as consistent prediction (Similar to PABEE). It makes me wonder why this was not tried.  It is claimed that the improvement in results (compared to PABEE) stems from the fact that PCEE-BERT requires some measurement of confidence in order to perform an early exit. To be convinced of this being the main explanation, I would have liked to see the two models compared in a “budgeted exiting” scheme and getting comparable results. If you can not perform such experiments for some reason, maybe address this in a “future work” section.\nWhat is the cost of using the PCEE-BERT? How does it affect training time? how many more parameters are added to the model? ",
    "comments": "Training the BERT base model with multiple intermediate classification layers may impede the performance of each separate layer (a Bert model with only 3 layers, will perform better than the 3rd layer on a full model trained with multiple classification layers). This is because the optimizer is focused on improving a single classifier’s loss (instead of many). For this reason, I would like to see the PCEE-BERT compared to smaller models (instead of a large model with budgeted exit).  Using only the speedup ratio for diagnosing the behavior of the model is lacking important information. Which layers are the ones actually being used? A histogram of the number of examples classified by each layer may reveal interesting evidence on the model’s performance. May also allow better comparison between models.  Some of the results in the paper suggest the “overthinking problem” may not exist. First, I fail to see how figure 1 demonstrates the problem at all. What I understand from this plot is that the MCC (which is a way of measuring the model's success) gets higher with the number of layers, and the entropy (which is an inverse measurement of how sure the model is of it's prediction) gets lower with the number of layers. So it seems to me that  the more layers the model has, the better it performs on both measurements, although it is possible that I am missing something. If the overthinking problem did exist, I would expect the mcc to have a maximum at an intermediate layer. Second, I would expect the performance of the model to slightly increase when the speedup ratio is low (but not 0). It seems from the results that the best performance is still achieved by the largest model. Hence, It seems that using the largest possible model would still yield the best results (as opposed to what is claimed in the overthinking problem).\nI am not a vision expert, but it seems to me that the ratio between added parameters of a classification layer and convolutional layers is much less significant than that of a simple FC layer and a transformer. Maybe the problem is actually non-existent in vision tasks?  It seems that adjusting PABEE through the patience parameter still provides a useful range for the S/R tradeoff. Can this not be done in real time? Am I missing something?  I fail to see how the ablation study of cross layer ensemble is relevant to this paper. You need to further explain why you are comparing PCEE-BERT to an ensemble model, and what insight did you gain from the results. In addition, the exact exit strategy of the model you are comparing PCEE-BERT to is unclear. Is it similar to a budgeted exit where you simply take the ensemble instead of the desired intermediate layer? or is it a PCEE-BERT in which when a decision to exit has been made, the ensemble is used instead of the intermediate layer?  Why is the loss structured that way? Why is it normalized? and why is it weighted?

    "paper_summary": "The authors present a method of adaptively truncating a BERT forward pass (or any deep-net with an iteratively-modified hidden vector a-la self-attention) at inference time in a classification setting; this method in theory allows a practitioner to trade off accuracy for latency: early-stopping takes fewer FLOPs but does slightly worse on average.\nThe model is, like the baselines compared to, adaptive, in the sense of allowing different test examples to use more or less computation as needed. The way it works is by training a per-layer classifier during finetuning for each layer; each hidden layer can be used to directly predict the label. Once a sufficient number of layers yield sufficiently low-entropy predictions, computation can be terminated (with both of these \"sufficiencies\" in the previous sentence corresponding to a different inference-time hyperparameter).\nThe classification tasks on GLUE are analyzed under this setting; the setup does a bit better than the competing adaptive-computation methods in the regime of heavily-truncated computations (only going through about 25% of the BERT's layers at test-time), and does comparably or marginally better, in general, than the other adaptive methods at less aggressive speedups.\nThe authors also demonstrate that the method is applicable to a ResNet trained on CIFAR to do vision classification.\nGenerally, the performance gains are not unambiguous and the settings in which this method is strongly preferred to other comparable systems could be clarified. I believe the comparison would be greatly strengthened by comparing directly to the more obvious way of reducing inference-time computation (namely, simply using a smaller fixed-sized model, comparable in FLOPs or wall-clock throughput to the adaptive large model).  I suspect the body of researchers interested directly in studying the performance-computation tradeoff of problems may find the work of interest---this method seems to consistently outperform the other comparable systems across a few of the tasks probed.

    "strengths": "- Comparison of this method to a number of directly comparable published adaptive computation methods on a number of baselines (GLUE tasks and a basic CIFAR-10/100 vision setup).\n- Method outperforms competing methods in very-restricted-computation regime (that is, when very aggressively early-stopping inference forward-passes).\n- Method does comparably or better than a few comparable systems for a few tasks across different accuracy/performance tradeoffs.\n- The method is intuitive and the presentation was generally clear (except a few smaller points of clarification I outline below in \"suggestions\"). ",
    "weaknesses": "- Not totally clear exactly when you'd want this scheme over the various other related early-stopping-adaptive-inference BERT setups. It seems like this setup generally works about the same as (or marginally better than) the others on many of the tasks (Table 2), and better in the regime of very-truncated computations (only doing a forward pass through 25% of the network on average). Could be clarified a bit if there are other clear differences in behavior beyond doing better in the very-aggressive-early-stopping regime.\n- The main comparison I'd really like to see is a comparison to smaller fixed-size models, ideally of different sizes. If the point of the early-exiting program is to save computation, then the most straightforward to reduce computation is to try a smaller model (simpler than a large model that does adaptive inference-time things which are not present during learning). It's possible that just using fixed-size smaller BERTs will do better in the performance-versus-latency tradeoff. I don't think this is a rejection-worthy shortcoming but I think it would really improve the strength of the claims in the paper.\n- I'm concerned by the speedup metric (this is not a rejection-level concern---I'm just arguing that they're using a proxy measurement without providing proof that it stands as a linearly-related proxy). The central results are task-specific-performance versus relative speedup afforded by the early stopping model. However, the speedup used as the x axis of the graphs is essentially the average percentage of layers the model goes through---that is, for a 50-layer BERT, if examples stop on average at layer 25, this will have a speedup ratio of 0.5. The authors assert \"according to our experiments, it is proportional to actual wall-clock runtime\". I think it's very important to show this, particularly because in the world of GPU usage and batching, there's often a weak coupling and non-linear relationship between the number of FLOPs required total (which is what this is) and the actual runtime (which depends on GPU utilization, which depends on the shape of the calculation, which depends on batching), and in particular this can vary from task-to-task. So this is a proxy measurement of efficiency (the \"efficiency\" we would actually care about in any setting is throughput or wall-clock time, rather than the number of flops required). The authors claim they observed a proportionality between the two, but the extent to which one actually stands as a proxy for the other (in particular, as a linearly-related proxy) seems very important to explicitly quantify and present. ",
    "comments": "- There's two task-specific hyperparams to set to parameterize early stopping, aren't there, the $\\tau$ param which binarizes the \"is this a low-entropy-enough\" decision, and the number of layers after which stopping occurs if the entropy's sufficiently low, I believe. These assumedly interact and each of them contribute to the speedup. How was this two-parameter decision turned into a single-parameter speedup? That is, the paper/system is motivated by there being a single knob to turn to control accuracy/computation tradeoffs, but this is two knobs, I think. Could be clarified in the \"experiments\" writeup.\n- Generally, I found the motivations somewhat contrived (the part about keeping up with high demand for flu queries via adaptively scaling back latency during flu season, for example, or sec 3.1 saying that the fact that there's a discontinuity in the PABEE latency-accuracy tradeoff curve, etc). It's not at all clear that \"the accuracy on this GLUE task must be exactly 60%\", as given in 3.1 as a desideratum limiting industrial applicability of other techniques, ever makes sense. I thing it really suffices to say \"we are investigating the accuracy/latency tradeoff, motivated by the fact that some applications will require lower latency\" and leave it at that? I would expect most readers would recognize this to be one of the central tradeoffs across the entire field and acknowledge that it's useful as an object of study.\n- Just to be clear -- the different early-existing classifiers $f^{(i)}()$, for $i=1,\\ldots,m$ each get the training label during fine-tuning right (that is to say, each of them is trained to predict the exact same label as the others, conditioned on a different intermediate vector)? This could be stated more explicitly in subsecs 2.2 and 2.2.1 (I may have just missed it).\n- What are the relative weights $m$ in 2.2.1? are they hyperparams? 2.2.2 seems to describe different schemes for using weights $m$ during inference, but aren't they needed during training? Are they fixed the same across the different setups?\n- hard to read table 2 because of its size. maybe if there's room in next revision or appendix turn each of these cols into a small fig like fig 3?

The first one is concatenating pinyin input to the context of  Chinese characters. The second one is adding a pinyin embedding layer at the bottom of GPT. Since the model needs to select the best one from characters pronounced with the same pinyin in the inference stage, they propose pinyin-constrained training.\nFor datasets, they use the common benchmark PD dataset for training and evaluation.

It is applied for read speech in English.\nThe method uses a conditional variational autoencoder to generate prosodic attributes for input text. The specific innovation of this paper is the cross-utterance conditioning, so that in order to synthesise prosodic speech for an utterance, the VAE is conditioned on text of several preceding and following utterances as well as the current one. This means, for example, that the phrase 'Mary asked the time' is given different prosody in the contexts 'Who asked the time? ------.' vs. '------, and was told it was only five'. The paper is clear about how this methodological contribution builds on and differs from other recent efforts to improve the prosody of TTS.  In addition, a set of several complementary evaluations are applied to judge the TTS output of this method. The subjective evaluations include human perceptions of naturalness, and AB testing for preference of systems with/out the cross-utterance context. Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of different components. Objective evaluations include word error rate (corresponding to intelligibility), reconstruction error, and expressive diversity (energy and pitch variability). The results show that using cross-utterance context leads to greater expression of appropriate prosodic variation. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper presents the idea of creating domain confused examples paired with contrastive learning for unsupervised domain adaptation. The authors propose identifying these puzzles in the representation space by utilizing adversarial examples---the method searches for an extreme direction that would shift a data point to the direction of the other domain. Then, the contrastive learning setup encodes these original and domain confused examples to be closer to one another, thus pulling examples from different domains closer to the domain discrimination boundary, encouraging models to learn domain invariant representations in the process. The authors further compare this method against other data generation schemes, such as back translation, finding that learning with domain confused examples provides far greater benefit. Further experiments show that the proposed method outperforms several strong baselines on two Amazon reviews benchmarks for sentiment analysis. I think this paper offers valuable contributions, both methodical as well as in the insights that are shared alongside quantitative results. ~I've also read the submitted previous reviews and feel confident in the author response. Overall, I think this paper could be a strong add to an ACL venue but I also have some concerns that I have laid below.

Performance of DSTs are measured using two metrics - joint goal accuracy and slot accuracy. Joint goal accuracy verifies if the predicted belief states perfectly matches the gold labels. This metric scores the performance of the later turns as zero even if the model mis-predicts a particular turn and performs accurately in the later turns. So, in this sense this metric this metric underestimates the model performance. On the other hand slot accuracy is a function of total number of predefined slots of all domains and by definition it is prone to overestimating the model performance. To solve these problems the authors propose a new metric called Relative Slot Accuracy that does not depend on the predefined number of unique slots and also scores the models in a way that matches human intuition.

Not every V+L task needs to test for something completely different than all others before it. One could also make the argument that the language itself is fairly artificial in the sense that these are not the sort of descriptions that would appear in any use case directly.

Other papers seem to go for the full SuperGLUE suite. Similarly, for those tasks, why is Autoprompt chosen as the only reference approach to compare against? Admittedly, the difference in performance to other approaches (at least for the SST-2 task) appears to not differ too much.  - It is great to see that confidence scores were reported for the obtained results, but how exactly are they calculated?\n- The high-level description helps to understand the approach intuitively, but a more detailed (e.g. mathematical) formulation, for example in the appendix, would be helpful as well. Similarly, the figure is supposed to help to understand the problem better, but I find it confusing in two ways: First, the figure is too abstract for me. Maybe having more text labels would help. Second, depicting sentiment analysis, it does not align well with the main contribution of the paper, improvements on the WiC task. Maybe reworking the figure to depict the WiC task would help with both problems.\n- Qualitative error analysis in the Appendix is great, but the manuscript so far lacks a more detailed analysis of the results.

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes presents a multi-task learning approach to improve low-resource stereotype recognition performance. The authors first critically analyse the state of the art in stereotype detection. Based on the resulting insights, they propose a new 4-way classification setup that is more suitable for the task and that guarantees a more systematic analysis of language phenomena in real-world data. Due to the limits of previously defined datasets, they propose a data collection to derive a crowd-sourced dataset based on Reddit content. Additionally, they use the same annotation protocol to analyse previous datasets as well. However, stereotype detection is a task with very few accurate data points. Therefore, they rely on the intuition that other related offensive language datasets could be used to boost performance. This is mostly because offensive language phrases are typically relying on specific stereotypes. In their evaluation, they use 6 offensive language datasets in a multi-task learning regime. This multi-task learning regime can be further enhanced with a policy that decides which data points to consider for training based on the classification performance. The policy is trained via an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm to optimise the F1 measure of the classification task. The authors tried this approach with several large-scale language models showing substantial performance improvement over the corresponding baselines. ",
    "strengths": "1. The authors completed an analysis of the literature which they use to define a data collection procedure based on a novel annotation scheme for stereotype detection; 2. The authors propose to combine several offensive language detection to boost performance in the stereotype classification setup; 3. The authors describe how to use a state of the art RL technique to combine multiple tasks together; 4. The paper clearly describes the problem that the authors are trying to solve and provide a very good evaluation to support their approach. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The multi-task learning approach defined in Section 4.1 is not described in detail. There are several ways of performing multi-task learning and the authors should be a little bit more precise in the description of their model. For a more systematic description of MTL approaches for Deep learning models, please refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05098. \n2. Multi-task learning generally struggles when tasks of different complexities are combined together (e.g., see GradNorm for a possible solution: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02257). On the other hand, the authors assume that multi-task learning is going to work without putting much effort into studying how each task affects the others. \n3. The authors perform an ablation where the model is trained using each neighbour dataset together with the reference dataset. However, to show the power of using multiple related tasks at the same time, it would be beneficial to see the effect on the overall performance, of different combinations of datasets. ",
    "comments": "Regarding the issue 1) and 2), I believe the authors should better describe their MTL approach and properly localise it in the literature. Additionally, the authors should provide more details about the training regime and what is the effect of combining different tasks at once. In this sense, weakness 3) can be useful to solve all the others. In particular, I would suggest the authors take their `bert-base` classifier, and train using MTL with different dataset combinations. For instance, assuming that their reference task is S and the related tasks are T_1, T_2, ..., T_6, I would evaluate the following combinations: 1. T_1 + S 2. T_1 + T_2 + S 3. (...) \n4. T_1 + T_2 + ... + T6 + S (this is the version with all the datasets that is currently implemented in the evaluation) In this sense, Table 4 goes in this direction. However, I believe the evaluation should focus on the performance of the stereotype detection task only because is the reference task for this paper. ",

General-purpose language models, like BERT, do not cover important domain-specific vocabularies, as a result, those models do not perform well in many downstream tasks. This paper addresses this limitation and proposes ConfliBERT, which is trained on text data from the area of social unrest, political violence, etc. ConfliBERT has two variations – (1) built from scratch, and (2) trained on top of pre-trained BERT. Experimental results show that either version performs better than BERT in several tasks related to this domain. ",
    "strengths": "+ This paper proposes a new language model for a domain. As the authors claim there are not any previous language models specific to this area. While this may boost research in this area, this new model can also help in developing new research questions. \n+ There is a lack of a large text corpus specific to this area. Addressing this issue, the authors develop this model by merging several existing datasets and creating a large dataset that is suitable to train a model like BERT. This corpus will be an important resource to conduct text data-driven research in this area. \n+ The paper evaluates its claims through a variety of experiments. The experiments are designed to include several types of problems, such as binary and multiclass classification, sequence labeling, on the other hand, each problem has been tested on several datasets. In all these experiments, the ConfliBERT has consistently outperformed the performance of the BERT model. These results demonstrate the power of this model across a diverse set of problems and corpora (across the world) and the need for a domain-specific language model in this context. \n+ The work is reproducible, where the paper furnishes details about the implementation, datasets, and hyperparameters and also the system configuration for training. ",
    "weaknesses": "-\tWhile this model is one of its kind in this area, the language model’s scope is too narrow to have a wide range of applications. Other similar BERT-based models (e.g. BioBERT, SciBERT) has a wider coverage. The authors should strengthen the claim of the importance of this model by discussing important problems in this area and how this language model will be essential in addressing a wide variety of problems in this domain. \n-\tAlthough ConfliBERT is a novel language model, the concept, methodology, implementation follows the BERT model. While it can contribute to the area of political science and computational social science in general, it is not clear how this work contributes to the area of NLP. \n-\tThe paper lacks a sound discussion to explain certain observations. Although, the experimental results unanimously show that for problems related to this domain ConfliBERT is a better choice but it is not clear which version of ConfliBERT is better, SCR or Cont. On many occasions, we see that the Cont version (built on top of BERT) performs better than SCR. This raises two questions – under what conditions Cont is more likely to perform better and given that Cont is trained on top of BERT, what are the features of BERT that are important in this case.  The paper should address the merits of BERT that are part of Cont but not of SCR. Additional experiments may help to show whether this is a data problem or a model problem. ",

They validate this claim by showing how such a language model can improve downstream tasks in this area. The paper is clearly written and the claims are evaluated well using an extensive set of experiments. \nThe advantage and the utility of the proposed language model are clear but there remain a few gaps that are important to understand the full strength of this model. The authors should present a clear discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of using the domain-specific datasets used in the training. The authors discussed that their dataset has additional words related to terrorism that are not present in a more general-purpose corpus but are there any other types of words that enriched the training of ConfliBERT? We see that only 3 out of 9 problems are related to terrorism. Indeed, the SCR model performed better in all the tasks involving terrorism-related data. On the other hand for protest-related data, we see a mixed performance, where Cont doing better in 2 out of 3 cases. For the case of Cont, are there any disadvantages for not using a general-purpose model/data? What is the percentage of vocabulary that is present in the general dataset but not in the domain-specific data? If this percentage is large, will that create a roadblock in the wider applicability of this language model? On the other hand, having too many unrelated words in the general-purpose data can act as noise for more domain-dependent tasks? The paper will benefit from a more in-depth analysis and comparison of the datasets used against a more generic corpus. \nMinor point: On page 6, section 5.2, lines 514, 515, it is not clear how the p-values were computed.

    "paper_summary": "The paper describes a novel prompt-based transfer learning approach for text generation i.e., PTG. Their method learns a fixed number of source prompts (represented as vectors) based on source generation tasks and then derives a target prompt for the target generation task. The latter is achieved using an adaptive attention mechanism that utilizes both task-level and instance-level information. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a diverse set of source-target tasks under different experimental conditions that test how the approach performs under various data-scarce settings (defined w/ respect to the target task). Additionally, the source prompts will be released as an open-source library to enable future experimentation on prompt-based transfer learning in other tasks/domains. ",

It gives insights into the role of different components of the proposed approach through ablation experiments and further confirms the author’s intuition on the properties of the learned source prompts via semantic similarity analysis;   d) The authors will release their source prompts as an open-source library which can be used to test how the approach can be adapted/extended to model other generation tasks; e) Overall, the paper is clearly presented and is well written (I have several recommendations on how writing can be further fleshed out but I believe that all my comments can be reasonably addressed in the camera ready version).

Yet, we are left unclear on its limitations. What are some target tasks that could potentially be hard to benefit from transfer learning under the PTG framework? If space permits, the authors could add a paragraph explaining their thoughts on “Limitations”. ",
    "comments": "[General Question] The final matching score between the instance x and prompt p_t requires setting a hyperparameter λ that defines the relevant contribution of the task- and instance-level information. Can you expand on how you choose this parameter for each task? More crucially, how sensitive are your results on the choice of this parameter per task and dataset choice? Do you have results on how the performance varies across different choices of λ, or alternatively, do you have an intuition on what types of target tasks might benefit more from larger instance- vs. task-information contributions?\n[Section 1] High-level comment: The problems of adaptation to (a) a new task vs. (b) a new domain are discussed in parallel. The introduction can be fleshed out a bit more to present the two problems separately and clarify/motivate how the proposed approach targets each of them. Additionally, the terms “domain” and “datasets” are used interchangeably throughout the paper (i.e., “domain” is line 46 vs. “datasets” in lines 62). Consider sticking to one term throughout the paper?\n[Section 1] line 39: “corpus” -> “corpora” [Section 1] lines 55-58: Is this the first work that framed generation tasks as language modeling by predicting the next token given previous tokens?   [Section 1] line 78: Can you expand on what the “soft prompts” are? It is hard to understand what is meant out-of-context.\n[Section 1] line 63: In the previous paragraph you refer to the problems of adapting to a new task and datasets. Starting in line 63 you are listing prompt-based methods that address only the first part of the issue. Consider clarifying what you mean by “this problem” in beginning of the  paragraph?\n[Section 1] lines 84-86: Can you provide some more context on whether/how the difficulty of transferring relates to the similarity/nature of the two tasks (i.e.,  source and target)?  [Section 1] lines 89-94: Can you give examples of two different instances drawn from the same task that should be handled using different prompts? This is crucial, to understand why incorporating instance-level information is needed and can help motivate better your approach!\n[Section 1] line 110: At this point of the paper it is unclear what “prompt clusters” referred to.  [Section 1] lines 128-134: Since this is a transfer setting that involved different levels of supervision from multiple tasks and domains (source vs. target datasets) it is not super clear what the “fully-supervised” and “few-shot settings” refer to. It becomes clearer later on in the experimentation section that those terms refer to target sets, but it would be better to clarify early on.  [Section 3] line 197: Another benefit of working with continuous prompts (that is also specific to your approach) is that it allows you to form prompt clusters, something that is not straightforward to do with discrete prompts. Maybe use this to explain/motivate why you opt for continuous prompts early on the problem formulation?\n[Section 3] lines 224-227: Need to clarify: Are the source prompts learned jointly for all source tasks?\n[Section 4] lines 242-248: Does that imply that both source prompts and clustered prompts are included in the pool? Can you clarify on what the size of the source prompt pool is (in a similar way you are introducing source prompt dimensions in the preliminary section)? To make understanding easier, I would start by outlining what the role of source prompts and cluster prompts is in the beginning of 4.1 and then expand on the more low-level details of how each of them is computed.  [Section 4] lines 379-401: The ‘Model Discussion’ subsection seems more of an outline of the approach rather than an actual discussion. Consider rephrasing it and move it in the beginning of section 4?\n[Section 5] lines 425-446: When describing the baselines it would be useful to comment on whether each of them (a) employs transfer or not, (b) is prompt-based or not . Ideally, such a clusterings should be shown in the Tables and discussion in the results section as it seems there are multiple layers of comparisons made here.   [Section 5] lines 448-449: Which PLM is used by your approach? ( I saw that the answer to the question is BART based on details provided in the Appendix, but it is preferable that this context is provided in the Experimental Setup to help make comparisons with other baselines more meaningful) [Section 5] Subsection Header: “Fully-Supervised Setting” is not self-explanatory. Can you describe the two settings “supervised” and “few-shot” in the experimental setup before moving to the results discussion?\n[Section 5] lines 470-482: It is unclear what the exact experimental setting looks like for each of the “cross-task” and ‘cross-dataset“ sets of experiments. I would move details on that in the Experimental Setup section and discuss only the results in this one. Additionally, I have the feeling that whatever is discussed in text in this paragraph could be more concisely presented in a Table. Can you explicitly show what the source and target tasks are for each of the  Tables 1 and 2?\n[Section 5] line 468: I would replace the term “cross-dataset” with “within-task” to make it clear that the setting is constrained on datasets of the same nature (cross-tasks might as well refer to two datasets from different tasks).\n[Section 5] 493-509: For each of the paragraphs describing the results, can you add specific references to the Tables the reader should refer to?  [Section 5] Tables 1 & 2:  The first 4 rows of Tables 1 and 2 collapse to the same settings and are thus repeated. Consider removing them from Table 2?\n[Section 5] Tables 1 & 2: Apart from discussing the results of Table 1 and 2 in isolation, could you also add a small discussion on how your approach yields similar performances across the “cross-task” and “cross-dataset” settings? What are the implications of that? How does that inform future decisions when choosing the source tasks given a known target task?\n[Section 5] Tables 3 & 4: It is very hard to read those Tables. I believe what is really important to get out of those numbers is how metrics change in a relative manner when moving to fewer and fewer samples. Consider, instead replacing those tables with graphs (with #of samples in the x axis) and present just one or two metrics in the main text (moving the rest to Appendix for completeness)?\n[Section 5] line 558: You mentions that the drop is *significant*, did you employ significance testing for numbers presented in Table 5? If not, consider smoothing out the text and maybe just quantify the drops. ",

    "paper_summary": "This work deals with a purported flaw of modern neural OpenIE systems: their tendency to extract overly specific arguments which are not useful for upstream tasks. The authors present a neural OpenIE system which produces “compact” extractions. The concept of “compactness” isn’t explicitly defined, but examples are provided and various proxies are supplied (e.g. triplets should be as short as possible without affecting the semantics, triplets shouldn’t contain arguments which are in themselves triplets).    The suggested solution is innovative in two ways: 1. It is based on a new training and evaluation dataset. This dataset is derived from a standard one using a heuristic algorithm which identifies and extracts compact triplets while filtering out complex ones.  2. A novel OpenIE algorithm is employed: it is based on a slot filling architecture recently suggested for relation extraction, but in this work it’s employed as part of a pipeline system which the authors show further increases performance. ",
    "strengths": "1. The paper deals with an important practical problem of how to optimize the usefulness of Open IE triplets for upstream tasks.  2. The paper is clear and does a great job of reviewing the literature in this area and citing relevant sources.  3. The authors suggest a pipeline approach: a table filling stage for the identifying arguments and predicates, and a second stage model which links the two. I think combining these ideas is indeed novel, and the authors also show that the suggested solution performs better than an end-to-end solution based on table filling alone.  4. Both automatic and manual evaluation methods are used to show that the suggested solution performs better than existing approaches on IE datasets modified to contain compact extractions. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. I think the paper goes a bit too quickly from the problem description of systems producing extractions which are too specific, to their specific flavor of “compact” extractions designed to solve this problem. The paper does cite different sources which explain the problem in more depth, but I don’t think there’s a consensus that the type of compact extractions the authors promote is the ideal solution for the problem. \nE.g. based on the criteria for informative extractions described in the paper “Annotating and predicting non-restrictive noun phrase modifications” (Stanovsky et. al 2016), extracting “Hercule Poirot” “is” “a Belgian detective” from the sentence  “Hercule Poirot is a Belgian detective, created by Agatha Christie” might not be specific enough (as the modification here seems restrictive). More discussion of this criteria and how it relates to compact extractions will be helpful.\n2. Continuing the above point, the evaluation in this paper is intrinsic and uses datasets modified to include extractions of the type the authors are promoting, so comparison to existing systems is not 1:1. Some kind of extrinsic evaluation (e.g. on a KBC or KB alignment task) could be helpful in showing that the suggested openIE method does in fact work better for upstream tasks.\n3. The authors give no indication of whether the modified datasets, code, system, or the data used in manual evaluation will be made available. Assuming these are not public, it is harder still to estimate whether the suggested approach is really a good fit for upstream tasks (this is also why I give this paper low reproducibility scores. If the authors were to share code/data, I would have assigned a higher score). ",
    "comments": "Despite the stated weaknesses, I'm narrowly in favor of accepting this paper. It deals with an important and not frequently discussed practical problem (making OpenIE triplets more useful for upstream tasks), the approach is interesting and the evaluation shows that the system produces triplets of the type the authors advocate more accurately than other systems (I think more can be done to convince that this style of queries is indeed optimal for upstream tasks, but still, this work seems like a step in the right direction).\nI would highly encourage the authors to make the code, datasets and sample extractions public, as it can really increase the impact of this work, allow others to consume and evaluate the outputs in real-world tasks, etc. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes DAR, which improves dense retrieval models with MixUp interpolations and dropout perturbation. MixUp (Zhang+ 2018) was initially proposed for image models, which creates augmented examples by linearly interpolating both the representations and labels between positive-negative sample pairs.  This work applies this technique to dense  text retrieval, and augments the original contrastive loss with soft binary cross-entropy losses. Furthermore, this paper also explores perturbing the representations with 0.1 dropout rate, and this technique can be combined with the MixUp strategy.\nExperiment on the DPR framework shows that DAR significantly outperforms vanilla DPR and its combinations with different data augmentation strategies (QA,DA,AR). The improvement is more prominent on unlabeled documents (not seen during training).  Oblation study shows that perturbation is only marginally helpful by itself, but a lot more helpful when combined with MuxUp.  Experiment on the ANCE framework shows that combining ANCE with DAR significantly improves MRR, and marginally improves R@1k. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper describes a contrastive learning approach to automatically solving math word problems (MWP) and investigates multilingual approaches to the problem. Additionally, it provides further evidence that the top layers of BERT will learn task-specific patterns, as shown in prior works.  This paper treats MWP solving as a text-to-equation-tree translation problem using an encoder-decoder architecture. To motivate the use of contrastive learning, the paper opens with an analysis of the effect of training epoch and encoder layer on the clustering of MWPs by prototype equation. t-SNE plots show expected clustering effects as layer/epoch increases. Analysis of raw high dimensional representations show that problems with similar lexical semantics or topic are given different representations when the prototype equation differs, especially in layer 12, while problems with the same prototype equation are embedded closer together. Moreover, it is shown that MPWs that are represented closer to the center of the cluster of problems with the same prototype equation are more likely to be correctly solved.  The contrastive learning approach proposed here involves finding difficult negative examples, which is done by choosing structurally similar equation trees with different operations in the intermediate nodes. Additional positive examples come from either trees or subtrees which consist of the same structure and operations as the target equation. For the multilingual approach, mBERT is substituted as the encoder. Results show that the contrastive learning method improves MWP solving in both the monolingual and multilingual settings compared to recent baselines. Ablations show the value of choosing difficult negative examples and other design decisions. Analysis shows that the contrastive learning objective results in well defined clusters. Accuracy is especially improved for examples farther from the cluster center. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper employs contrastive learning to improve performance on Math Word    Problems (MWP) tasks. The use of contrastive learning is motivated by the    observation that ``semantically similar'' problems appear closer together in    the embedding space, despite belonging to different problem classes. After    demonstrating this phenomenon via several angles, the authors train a seq2seq    MWP model (BERT encoder + tree decoder) supplemented with a contrastive loss    --- mono- and multilingually. They show that, in learning from both positive    and negative examples, their model outperforms many baselines, as well as the    non-contrastive model. Furthermore, they demonstrate that employing    contrastive learning a multilingual scenario improves performance w.r.t. the    multilingual non-contrastive case. These results are supplemented by thorough    analyses. ",
    "strengths": "This paper is generally thorough. After introducing the    problem (albeit very opaquely), the authors proceed to provide a simple    solution and show strong empirical evidence in its support. They a offer    unique application of contrastive learning to an under-explored problem and    highlight how its usage can be generalized. The analysis before and after    training is strong and insightful. ",
    "weaknesses": "The main weakness of this paper is the motivation, which is extremely    imprecise. The pedagogical literature cited in lines 36-46 is opaquely    summarized and does not lend sufficient grounding for introducing the    problem: \"mathematics is about patterns and not merely about numbers\";    \"...students explore patterns, not just memorize procedures\". The authors    distill these insights into their hypothesis, where they posit that    \"semantics affects problem-solving\". The word \"semantics\" is used    extremely liberally here, and it is was unclear to me what the authors    actually meant here (vs. prototype equations). The analysis and discussion    offered by Section 3 is difficult to follow because of this, and it is not    clear how instances \"similar semantics\" are tracked or computed (see, e.g.    Figure 3). Upon several re-readings, it became apparent that what the authors    actually refer to is lexical overlap (at least as evidenced by Probs C and D    in Figure 1). Due to this, the representation clusters for each prototype    equation tend to be expanded by the problems with high lexical overlap across    classes. This is more or less straightforward, but more care needs to be    devoted to making the language precise and less lofty. ",
    "comments": "Comments:    * When investigating cosine similarity, authors should consider the work that    investigates MLM embedding spaces, namely    https://aclanthology.org/D19-1006.pdf and    https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.372.pdf, which discuss the    anisotropy phenomenon.     * It would be interesting to see how the embedding spaces look like for BERT      out of the box.\n   * It is important to make distinction between `procedures' and 'patterns'    Questions:    * What layer are the plots in the top row in Figure 2 from?

    "paper_summary": "This paper presents and empirically confirms the \"prompt waywardness hypothesis\" in the context of continuous prompt tuning. The hypothesis is that for any arbitrary text there exists a continuous prompt whose discrete projection is said arbitrary text *and* whose resulting performance is almost as good as the best possible continuous prompt. Therefore, the paper suggests, it is difficult to evaluate continuous prompts in a discrete space because there always exist good continuous prompts that map to random or misleading discrete text.\nA little more formally, the hypothesis is that for any downstream task and arbitrary text $p_d$ of length L, there exists some continuous prompt $\\tilde{p}_c$ of length L such that $\\tilde{p}_c$ results in a test loss close to that of the best continuous prompt $p^*_c$ of length L, and yet $\\tilde{p}_c$ projects to $p_d$ (when projected into discrete space).\nThe authors empirically confirm this hypothesis by showing that for five downstream classification tasks they are able to find continuous prompts which project to certain arbitrary sentences (at least very closely, as evaluated by F1) but whose resulting accuracy is almost as good as that of the optimal prompt (as evaluated by the difference in test accuracy). These experiments use the GPT-2-large model (except when model size is ablated), and projection is defined as follows: continuous prompts are projected to discrete space by finding the token with the nearest-neighbor embedding (where token embeddings are taken to be GPT-2's embedding matrix). Finally, the paper discusses implications of the prompt waywardness hypothesis, the main implication being that continuous prompts may never be interpretable by being projected to discrete language.

The conclusion that encouraging continuous prompts to project to semantically accurate instructions (Appendix B) provides interesting insight into the function of continuous prompts. ",
    "weaknesses": "The implications discussed in the paper apply *if* one were to try to project continuous prompts to discrete space using GPT-2's (or any other) embedding matrix, but, as far as I am aware, no one has attempted to interpret continuous prompts in this way. The paper could be strengthened by more explicitly discussing *why* we should be concerned with this particular method of prompt interpretation: 1. Do the authors think we should be especially concerned about nearest-neighbor, embedding matrix projections because that's how language model outputs and word2vec are calculated? This seems to be the case, but could be made more explicit. It's not clear why the use of an embedding matrix at the output layer of language models implies this would be a popular way of discretizing continuous prompts. \n2. Is it because the particular discrete projection studied is the simplest that the authors believe it might be used in the future? \n3. Do the authors think their hypothesis generalizes to other methods of discretely interpreting prompts? If so, that could also be made more explicit. ",

Although we can predict the same input sentence for different types one-by-one if a sentence contains multiple events of the same type, the same input (template and sentence) will correspond to various outputs. For example, some sentences have two death events. This is not a problem for other generation methods because they are trigger-driven (TANL, BART-GEN), or generate all extracted events in one step (Text2Event).\n- Converting generated results to events: Are there some generated results that cannot be parsed into events? Generation methods are more uncontrollable than span extraction and span classification methods for event extraction. For example, the generated span maybe not appear in the input sentence.\nThere are many template methods for information extraction. \nIt is suggested that authors should cite these articles: - Template-Based Named Entity Recognition Using BART.

From the results in table 1, it seems like the proposed model is more likely to help when 5%-10% of training data are provided.

However, annotating that amount of data is also labor-intensive and hard to get for novel classes we might want to extract in the future.  Besides that, the used template seems to be a powerful prior knowledge. For example, as discussed in table 4, using the keywords only can lead to almost the same performance of the model. Can you provide more discussion on how many tested triggers are covered by the provided keywords? I suspect that there might be a big overlap.  Compared with using 10% of data, zero-shot is a more interesting and realistic data-scare setting. ( If we can afford to annotate some data, why not just annotate more). Unfortunately, experiments in the appendix do not compare with existing zero-shot approaches for the event extraction tasks [1, 2, 3] Last but not least, the high-quality template and keywords may not always be available in real applications.

    "paper_summary": "This paper presents new methods for zero/few-shot classification focusing on improving inference and training time costs. Few-shot classification is a challenging setting where very little training data is available (5-100 examples per label). Recent work has seen that entailment models are effective at zero/few-shot classification, where the input sentence is used as the premise and label strings are used as hypothesis. Inference from these types of approaches typically need a number of forward passes (equal to the number of labels) through a large pretrained model, which involves an expensive cross-attention step between the input sentence and hypothesis.\nThe first method proposed in the paper uses a dual-encoder / Siamese network to separately encode the premise and hypothesis. This is much more efficient at inference, since label vectors can be cached and only the input sentences need to be encoded once (rather than as many times as the number of labels). The paper further proposes \"label tuning\", where the premise encoder is kept fixed, and only the label embeddings are tuned. This helps significantly reduce training time cost, and allows deployment of a single shared premise encoder for input sentences across various different tasks (saving memory costs).\nThe authors validate their approach on several classification datasets in English, German and Spanish. Siamese Networks perform similar to their cross-attention counter-parts. Label tuning is not as effective, but a lot of performance can be recovered using knowledge distillation. ",
    "strengths": "1. Zero/few-shot classification is a very important and practically relevant problem. This paper is well-grounded into state-of-the-art research in few-shot learning and has an excellent literature survey.\n2. The paper identifies an important limitation of current few-shot methods using entailment approaches (slow inference time), and does a thorough analysis comparing the proposed more efficient Siamese networks with the expensive cross-attention models, finding little difference in performance. Moreover, the authors have an interesting finding that simply using the label strings themsleves (instead of hand-crafted prompts / strings) are equally effective.\n3. The authors further improve training/inference time time/memory efficiency using label tuning, where the input encoder parameters are kept fixed, and only label vectors are finetuned. Since this leads to a performance drop compared to approaches which fine-tune the encoder network, the authors propose using knowledge distillation from the fine-tuned model to recover part of the performance.\n4. The paper has several experiments in both English and multilingual settings. A total of 16 datasets are studied, and results tables comprehensively compare different variants of the models. The paper also has good analysis experiments studying inference time speed, performance by token length, the effect of negation markers. ",
    "weaknesses": "No major concerns, added minor points in the Comments section. I thought this was a well-written paper overall with good contributions.

They adopt the design of T5 for other components of the Transformer and pre-train the model using the gap sentence prediction objective by Pegasus. The resulting model, LongT5, outperforms existing models designed for long sequences on long document summarization with arXiv, PubMed, BigPatent, and MediaSum.

It is likely that the improved performance is due to the authors' better computational resource that allows longer inputs.

    "paper_summary": "This paper introduces a new dataset and a different problem setting for automatic fact-checking. The authors argue that it makes more sense to formulate automatic fact-checking as an entailment problem in which the veracity of the claim is evaluated against existing evidence. Authors demonstrate that by modifying a recent dense passage retrieval method proposed by Karpukhin et. al. (2020), they can improve over a TF-IDF baseline. ",
    "strengths": "Authors offer a more realistic problem setting for automated fact-checking using existing data sources.\nEvaluation framework (prequential evaluation) used in this study is the more appropriate evaluation framework that takes into account the temporal aspect of fact-checking, than static accuracy and F1 scores. Aside from evaluation, the paper also follows a sound research design in general. ",
    "weaknesses": "This dataset is very similar to the FEVER formulation of fact-checking, it's just data from a different and more noisy domain, which is of course a more realistic problem setting for automated fact-checking. The approach the authors propose is still useful but not very novel.  At least some version of this data has been previously released in other publications. See https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.86/ , https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.623/ .\nBriefly at the end of the abstract and In 5.1 (Stage-1 Results) in detail, you mention that your dense passage retrieval approach improves over a TF-IDF baseline. Why is that improvement significant enough to be published? Since you are only comparing with a simple baseline, It is difficult to tell how much improvement is good improvement.\nThe negative pairs used for training the dense passage retrieval model appear to be selected at random. This presents a known issue about negative sampling into the problem setting: because it's easier to distinguish negative example pairs than positive ones, your final model ends up learning to do the easier task. Since learning the discrepancy between irrelevant and randomly selected <claim, article sentence> pairs is much simpler than learning the similarity between relevant <claim, article sentence> pair, the model ends up not learning very much. ",
    "comments": "How do you handle false negatives in your problem formulation? I couldn't find any references to automatic or manual deduplication of the claims in your data, and this data clearly may contain different versions of the same claim fact-checked multiple times. How do you make sure that the false negatives in your dataset do not disturb your evaluation? i.e., what if model A is performing better than model B in your task, but because model A is picking more on those false negatives and you only count performance based on true positives, you end up showing model B superior, where in reality model A is superior but your evaluation is noisy?

    "paper_summary": "The paper introduces a new fact-checking dataset, containing claims from a variety of fact-checking websites. No annotations are performed. Instead, the dataset combines each claim with its review written by a human fact-checker (working for the respective fact-checking site) and all background articles mentioned in the review. The main task to be solved using the dataset is claim verification based on background articles. The full dataset contains over 30k claims.\nThe authors experiment with various baselines models for solving this task in a two-step approach. The first is sentence retrieval with the goal to retrieve those sentences from all background articles that belong to background articles of a claim. The authors compare TF-IDF with a BERT architecture, where the latter shows better performance. In a second step, the top retrieved sentences are used for veracity prediction. Here, a Bi-LSTMs, hierarchical attention networks, and RoBERTa are compared, with the RoBERTa model outperforming the others.\nThe authors also show that there is a time-dependent topic shift in the dataset, which affects performance. That is, if the model was to be applied to new data collected in the future, a drop in performance is to be expected due to the topic shift. ",

Particularly the latter dataset considers links found in the review articles just as in the WatClaimCheck datast, the only difference being that only the Snopes website is used. \n-\tGiven that the main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new dataset, more analysis of the dataset would have been useful. For example, is there any overlap of claims, background documents, or (more generally) topics between the claims extracted from the various different sources? ",
    "comments": "-\tIt would be interesting to know if there is a particularly reason that the authors frame the retrieval task (stage 1) as sentence retrieval rather than as document retrieval. \n-\tIt was not completely clear to me whether the retrieval model is trained only on the new dataset or if the model pre-trained on the QA task is further fine-tuned on the dataset. \n-\tIn addition to the two datasets mentioned in the “Weakness” section there are others that could be useful to compare against, see e.g. “Automated fact-checking: A survey” by Zeng et al. 2021 or “A Richly Annotated Corpus for Different Tasks in Automated Fact-Checking” by Hanselowski et al. 2019 for further references. \n-\tIn Table 1, it is stated that the Vlachos and Riedel 2014 dataset has no Evidence, however in the paper it is stated that “we also collected the sources used by the journalists in the analysis provided for the verdict. Common sources include tables with statistics and reports from governments, think tanks and other organisations, available online”. \n-\tIn Section 4.2.2, is it correct that for each claim-true_sentence_from_review pair, n=number_of_claims incorrect sentences are chosen? Furthermore, are these incorrect sentences chosen from one other review article or each sentence from a different review article? \n-\tIn Section 4.2.2, it is unclear what the “top scoring” sentences (line 417) are. Do you choose a certain number of sentences or do you define a cut-off threshold? \n-\tThe fact that the claimant is included in the veracity prediction hints at the authors’ assumption that certain claimants are more or less likely to make true/false claims. It would be useful here to investigate this relationship between claimant and veracity as well as to exclude the claimant from the prediction (only use claim and evidence) to figure out what the weight of the claimant in this prediction is (maybe the model does not actually learn to predict the veracity from the evidence but rather from the claimant). \n-\tIn Section 4.3.3, how do you deal with the RoBERTa token limit? \n-\tIn Section 5.1 it would be useful to report the total number of sentences in the test set so that the reader has an idea of the difficulty of the retrieval task. \n-\tIn Table 3 the authors report the performance based on the review of a claim as the upper bound. However, it seems to me that a better upper bound would be the prediction based on true background articles. \n-\tIt would be interesting to also report or mention the class-wise F1 scores for veracity prediction and to analyse the confusion between the classes as a confusion between the True and False is much more severe than between True (or False) and the Partially True (False) labels.

Also, it is better for authors to include textCNN/LSTM (1 of them is enough) for text classification, which can show whether non-pretrained models can be used under PLASM.\n2.

Usefulness. we know very well at this point that PTLMs' performances degrade when data distribution shifts; we also know that the magnitude of degradation depends on tasks, domains, or even different models themselves.

But I think that's likely the initial steps most researchers would do and hardly provide new directions on how to address the problem more effectively. I recommend the authors to look at some earlier works on the drift of meaning in word embedding such as \"Dynamic Embeddings for Language Evolution\" and \"Conditional Word Embedding and Hypothesis Testing via Bayes-by-Backprop,\" and see if there are possibilities to incorporate or even invent new methods to address the issue. \n2.

    "paper_summary": "The goal of the presented research was to improve results for NLP tasks requiring semantic understanding. Bert-like models while performing very well in many NLP tasks give much lower results when the differences in semantics, e.g. negation, are tested. Some solutions for improving handling negation were presented before, here the authors looked also into another semantics related task – synonyms and antonyms detection. They propose a new solution – intermediate training on tasks related to meaning matching.   The authors propose three tasks: masked knowledge retrieval on negated queries (MKR-NQ), masked word retrieval (MWR), and synonym/antonym recognition (SAR). In the first one, they negated the LAMA dataset  - for sentences with one verb the negation was added (or removed) and the different answers were picked.  For the MWR task, queries, like “happy is the synonym of [MASK]”, were used. The number of wrong predictions, i.e. words which are in a different relation to a  given word at the top of the list of the most probable predictions were counted.   In the last task, the relation between a  pair of words  - synonymy or antonymy was predicted. To create this set data from ConceptNet was used.  To illustrate the lack of information of negation and lexical semantics in  Bert models, all three tasks were first solved using several (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, Electra in small and large versions) already trained models;  only for the SAR task the additional training was performed. In general, the results of all the models measured by the hit rate metrics were not good. It looked like the synonymy/antonymy relations cannot be retrieved.  For MKR-NQ and MWR tasks large models were generally worse than small ones. For the SAR task, fine-tuning improved the results significantly.  To encode the needed information in language models, the authors proposed the approach with the intermediate model training on the newly defined meaning matching task. The training set consisted of word-sentence pairs. The same three tasks were then solved using the resulting models and generally, there was a significant increase in the results for the large models. However,  for the Elektra model, the results were worse. \n The authors also checked if the additional training step can negatively influence the results obtained on the other tasks. The results obtained for 8 tasks from the GLUE benchmark did not change much. So the authors conclude that their approach (IM2) is of benefit to learning lexical-semantic information and the meaning of negated expressions. ",
    "strengths": "The authors address the important problem of language models based on distributional hypothesis – words which occur in the same context may be of the same category but semantically significantly different, e.g. ‘cat’/ ‘dog’, ’long’/ ‘short’. It is also hard to differentiate negated and not negated sequences. They propose a method that helps in recognizing negation in a more efficient way than it was proposed in BERTNOT and at the same time helps in differentiating synonyms and antonyms.  The series of experiments are well planned and sufficiently described. ",

    "paper_summary": "This work presents a study of factual hallucinations, wherein summarization models hallucinate information (i.e. generate information not present in the source document) which is still factually correct. An example of this would be background knowledge about the summarization topic. The main contributions are: (1) an annotation of a subset of the XSUM summarization dataset at the entity level, including both hallucination, and factuality (2) A simple, yet effective classification method for the labels of 1, using a KNN classifier on conditional and unconditional entity probabilities as well as presence in the source document (3) Use of their classifier to guide offline RL training of a summarizer to improve factuality. Authors find the classifier is effective and correlates well with humans, and the RL summarizer achieves better faithfulness/factuality than baselines while not significantly sacrificing ROUGE. ",
    "strengths": "From my perspective, the strongest aspect of the paper is the annotated dataset. The value of entity-level annotations for hallucination and factuality for XSUM will be very useful for future work, both for training new methods and allowing comparison across a common, fine-grained benchmark for factuality/hallucination classification. \nThe paper also focuses on the notion of factual hallucination, which is often treated the same as non-factual hallucination in works on factuality. Whether or not I personally agree with the current feasibility of factual hallucinations to be useful in summarization systems, this is a question that warrants more discussion such as this work.   The experiments presented are quite extensive, spanning multiple datasets and generally demonstrating that the proposed methods are effective. \nThe notion of negatively weighting non-factual entities in the offline RL setting is interesting, and a natural way to incorporate the classifier into training. ",
    "weaknesses": "Generally, I found the evaluations could have been stronger. First, there are only two classification baselines and both of them are rule-based, given a fixed set of simple features. The paper does not discuss in detail why a method using simple probability/overlap based features should in general be better than simply training a classifier on the available data (e.g. a linear layer on top of RoBERTa), nor does it compare to a trained baseline. If the point of the proposed method is that the selected features are particularly strong, then the authors should compare to other features (i.e. neural). If the point of the method is that KNN is a good choice for these features, then the authors should compare to other algorithms on the same features. I particularly focus on the evaluation of the classifier because later sections of the paper (i.e. the RL-based model) use the classifier as a sub-routine, and so demonstrating its efficacy is particularly important. \nSome minor concerns: - The work suggests that hallucinations can be described by hallucinated entities, which may be factual or not. I found this a bit unnatural, as the entities themselves are unlikely to be factual or non-factual in isolation. Rather, facts involving these entities can be classified either way. This may be something to elaborate on in future versions of the work.\n- While I found the dataset to be useful, it is generated using one summarization model (based on BART) which may not well describe the kinds of mistakes that other models make, especially as new architectures/pretrained models are released in the coming months/years. As such, the dataset may have limited usefulness in the further future. ",
    "comments": "As mentioned above, I would suggest including further baselines for the classification task. If it is financially feasible, I would also suggest a small-scale human evaluation of even a subset of the summarization systems. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions based only on automatic notions of factuality and quality, particularly when we are comparing the two. My understanding is that the goal of this work is to show that methods such as the one presented here can improve factuality and factuality in hallucination without significantly damaging the quality of the summarization model. Without at least some human judgement, it is difficult to judge whether or not this holds. ",

Actually these examples are extracted from those instances, then why should we still have examples in BI? How about just having those instructions in the BI? \n2. One important baseline is missing: in those methods proposed for DecaNLP and UnifiedQA, etc., other types of tokens or phrases are used to indicate which task/dataset each input instance belongs to, which is very important to let the model know what the input instance it is. However, in the baseline of vanilla multi-task learning (V-BB), no such kinds of special tokens are used at all, which forms a very unfair baseline to be compared with. The model are fed by so many instances from various kinds of tasks without any differentiation, which for sure would lead to deteriorate performance. For this reason, the effectiveness or the necessity of BI is questionable. \n3. More deep analysis over the impacts of different kinds of designs of the BI is needed, since such designs can vary a lot among different designers or writers. If so, the performance would be very unstable due to the variance of BI, which makes this type of method not applicable to real-world problems. \n4.

Using such mixed representation instead of the one-hot representation as the token input can be regarded as a kind of data augmentation and can significantly improve the model performance in the low-resource regime.

It uses the knowledge of pre-trained BERT to integrate and compress information of multiple related words, providing richer semantics that a single token in the one-hot form cannot provide.  __3.

It would be better to conduct a significance test on the experimental results. \n     __2.

It would be interesting to include the comparison of using different pretrained langauge model for data augmentation to understand the benefits of model size in this pipeline. Especially, except LAMBADA and BACK T, all other previous methods seem not using model larger than BERT-base in their pipelines. If PromDA could consistently outperform the baseline and other models with smaller data augmentation model (e.g. BERT-base), it will further justify the effectiveness of proposed pipeline.\n2.

At the beginning of the paper, including the abstract and list of contributions, the claim about the components involved is slightly inconsistent with the rest. For instance, the 8th line in abstract is \"incorporates all components\", line 73 also says the \"whole encoder\", but on further reading, FFN (Feed forward layers) is omitted from the framework. This needs to be framed (rephrased) better in the beginning to provide a clearer picture.\n3. While FFNs are omitted because a linear decomposition cannot be obtained (as mentioned in the paper), is there existing work that offers a way around (an approximation, for instance) to compute the contribution? If not, maybe a line or two should be added that there exists no solution for this, and it is an open (hard) problem.

The key idea of the proposed method is to combine neural token representations and inductive logic programming (ILP) so that the reasoning chains are more interpretable to humans. The proposed method DILR is an end-to-end model, consisting of a hierarchical attentive reader module and a multi-hop logic reasoner, where the former continually produces a query&context-aware representation of entities, and the latter use them for softly selecting atoms to form logic clauses. A highlight of such a neural-symbolic method is that the final loss can smoothly be back-propagated to the trainable modules. ",

Please correct me if I missed anything here.\n- The model is limited to the triplet-format questions, which is limited to a pre-defined list of relations and may not generalize to other MRC datasets and other relations.\n- There are a few missing baseline methods such as DrKIT (Bhuwan Dhingra et al. ICLR 2020), which is also a differentiable multi-hop reasoning framework, focusing on entity mentions. Please also look at the datasets and baseline methods this paper used for evaluation.\n- There is no qualitative analysis of the used logic clauses for case studies.

The proposed approach does a beam search (with k=5) using the discriminator output to select compilable sequences. For the comparison to be fairer, the authors could consider extracting k=5 samples from the other models and filter for the ones that compile (+ use the model probabilities to break ties) or, almost equivalently, doing rejection sampling on the distribution P(c)*1[compiler(c)]. One can argue that this gives an advantage to the baselines because they have access to the compiler, but on the other hand, it would be possible to train an independent discriminator that predicts whether a sequence compiles or not, as it was done for the proposed model, and no access to the compiler would be needed. Alternatively, IR metrics such as MAP or Prec@k could be used. \n4. The claim that this is the first work to integrate the compiler feedback to improve compilability is not correct. Korbak et al.

The contrast sets are created by swiping the gender of a person or using pre-trained LMs to replace verb phrases with top K most probable phrases. They also use AMT to create human generated contrast sets and ask humans to evaluate if the automated contrast sets are valid. \nThe results show that the models performance drops significantly on contrast sets compared to original setting (the random negatives). They also show that model performance is strongly correlated with semantic proximity and stronger retrieval performance does not guarantee robustness to word-level manipulation. ",

Another way of explaining the current limitation of attribution evaluation is that these methods are almost never compared against counterfactuals (the only counterexamples I can think of are the causal model explanation papers). That is, we need benchmarks that include counterfactual examples where we know what is the type of manipulation that was done, and compare model predictions between the original examples and the counterfactual examples.\nMore broadly, we can think of model explanation as a causal estimation problem, and evaluate methods as we do in causal inference (sensitivity analysis and the likes). While this paper is not the place to invent new evaluation methods, I think that it’s worthwhile to highlight the potential connections between all these failures and the lack of causal thinking in the model interpretability literature.\nSecond, I think that the discussion points are a bit too vague and are not as thought out as the described logic failures. Especially in 3.3, I agree that we should want models that are robust to perturbations, but it is not a problem of evaluation methods, it’s a problem of model robustness.

    "paper_summary": "The paper uncovers critical issues around interpretability and explainability of the reasoning and performance of modern deep learning models. Using several theoretical and experimental analysis, it specifically reveals the weaknesses of existing attribution methods designed to qualify and support research propositions by assessing model predictions. Because of their deceptive nature i.e. easily disregarded or even missed, the paper presents these weaknesses as logic traps. For example, if input features responsible for certain predictions are perturbed, scores provided by attribution methods should reflect the significant change or difference in the model’s predictions given the perturbations. The paper highlights the potential damage of neglecting these traps such as inaccurate evaluation, unfair comparison, unmerited pressure to re-use unreliable evaluation techniques etc. In its analysis, the paper shows factual information of how attribution methods can be misleading when they approve of a model’s prediction countering the actual norm or expectation.  Two helpful examples of logic traps include, (1) the assumption that a humans' decision making process is equivalent to that of a neural network. In a question answering task, BERT base maintained its test set performance despite replacing development set samples with empty strings. Ideally, the performance would drop because of the perturbations, but it did not, therefore clearly misleading human decision making. Moreover, the paper empirically proves this error by showing a drop in the model's confidence in its prediction on unchanged samples. ( 2) A second example of a logic trap is using arribution methods as ground truth to evaluate target attribution method. In an evaluation based on meaningful perturbation, such as Area over the perturbation curve (AOPC) which is precisely the average difference between probabilities predicted with original input feature and those predicted with perturbed input features. While the norm expects this AOPC to be significant or at least representative of the degree of perturbation, the paper illustrates that the perturbation (modification) strategy will dictate the eventual AOPC value, i.e. it varies with respect to the modification strategy. Scores of different attribution methods when inputs are perturbed by token deletion are inconsistent with their scores when inputs are perturbed by token replacement. The paper concludes with suggestions of limiting the impact of logic traps such as the ones discussed. Enhancing the target model as well as Excluding predictions with lower confidence. ",
    "strengths": "Precise and concise abstract.\nThe paper is organised and well written.\nThe subject addressed is crucial for the deep learning community.

The paper exemplifies the flaws by highlighting how high-level goals of evaluation methods can be subverted or as the paper calls them, have \"logical traps\". These issues are shown exploitable to produce inconsistent preferences for an attribution method; i.e. the evaluation criteria are thus rendered pointless. The authors also make some points with regard to some views of what attributions should or should not be and argues otherwise. ",
    "strengths": "+ On its face the paper is right in its main point that evaluation criteria can be exploited to   produce inconsistent ranking of attribution methods, and in general the use of evaluation metrics   can be problematic to research in the area. ",
    "weaknesses": "1 The paper poses mostly subjective points which are themselves largely not novel or are flawed in   themselves. It starts with the emphasized sentence on page 1 attributed to Jacovi et al which I   will call \"Opinion A\":     \"As an explanation method, the evaluation criteria of attribution methods should be how      accurately it reflects the true reasoning process of the model (faithfulness), not how      convincing it is to humans (plausibility)\"   This point is debatable. Whether attributions should be purely faithful to model behaviour or   offer human-interpretability is a decision to be made in the definition of an attribution method   or its motivation. Neither option is wrong as long as the method is applied to its intended use   case. Further, the noted choice of faithfulness has implications on some of the \"logic traps\"   described subsequently. I elaborate on each in the comments section below.\n  Significant positioning fixes need to be implemented in this work starting with Opinion A.   Either arguments for faithfulness need to be made or the paper needs to restrict itself to   attributions whose primary concern is faithfulness. The latter option would have to be written   from the perspective that faithfulness is an apriori goal.\n  The novelty of arguments being made needs to be addressed as well. I find that the cores of the   \"logic traps\" are all known points and are often well considered in attribution, evaluation, and   robustness work. Presently the paper does not demonstrate that (logic traps) \"in existing   evaluation methods have been ignored for a long time\". If there is a gap in some segment of the   community, a survey or systemization paper where applicable would be more appropriate.\n2 Arguments and experiments with regard to \"model reasoning process\" are vague in key definitions   and thus non-convincing. Specifically, no definition of \"model reasoning process\" is given. \n  Experiment outlined in Figure 7 argues that extractor's bits are equivalent to \"model reasoning   process\" but this is arguable. The extractor can derive the same bits using different means or   different bits using very similar means. While I do not disagree with the main points regarding   model reasoning process and robustness, I do not think the experiments demonstrate them. ",
    "comments": "Detailed comments regarding Weakness 1):   * Logic Trap 1: The point being made is obvious:     \"The decision-making process of neural networks is not equal to the decision-making      process of humans.\"\n  The example Experiment 1 incorporates not a single attribution method. Is it presumed that all   attributions will be wrong as there is no human explanation possible? Can we also say that any   human explanation would be wrong for the same reason? If there is no ground truth, how can it be   wrong for an attribution method to say anything?\n  Regardless, no-one *expects* models to fully replicate the reasoning of a human. Replicating   human behaviour may be useful to gauge human-interpretability of explanations but this is   precluded by Opinion A.   Finally, it is well understood that what is correct to a human may not be correct in a model as   per faithfulness vs. explainability discussion which is had alongside attribution evaluations in   literature and in Opinion A (some examples from cited works below).\n  * Logic Trap 2: The second point made is a roundabout way of saying that ablation orders are     varied:     \"Using an attribution method as the ground truth to evaluate the target attribution method.\"\n  The authors are rightly pointing out that numerous forms of attribution evaluation based on   ablation or reconstruction inputs have been used to motivate attribution methods. Here the   opposite conclusion to Opinion A is helpful. Expecting humans to interpret an attribution one way   may lead to one ablation order whereas another form of interpretation may lead to another. There   is no single correct metric because there is no single interpretation. This point has been made   at least in [a].\n  * Logic Trap 3: The third point is known:     \"The change in attribution scores maybe because the model reasoning process is really changed     rather than the attribution method is unreliable.\"\n  Ghorbani et al. (2019) note in their concluding discussion that fragility of attribution is   reflective of fragility of the model (and that their attacks have not \"broken\" an attribution). \n  Likewise Alvarez-Melis et al. (2018) point out that the non-robust artifacts in attributions they   discover are actually reasonable if faithfulness to model is the only goal of an attribution. \n  Thus Logic Trap 3 does not seem to add anything beyond Opinion A.   * 3.1 -- \"Attacking attribution methods by replacing the target model.\"\n  This section seems to be pointing out that attribution methods have a problem of domain   faithfulness in that they often internally apply a model to inputs that they have not been   trained on or don't expect to operate reliably on.\n  * 3.2 -- \"Should We Use Attributions Methods in a Black-Box Way?\"\n  The paper argues that black-box is not a worthwhile goal. This is again highly subjective as   there are several reasons, despite presented arguments, to prefer black-box methods, like 1)   having explanations of the semantics of what a model is modeling instead of an explanation   tainted by how the model is implemented, 2) black-box means model agnostic, hence can apply to   any model structure, 3) some scenarios just do not have access to the model internals.\nOther comments: - The term \"logic traps\" is not define or explained. Dictionaries and reference materials equate   them to logical fallacies which I'm unsure is the intended meaning here.\n- The term \"erasure-based\" is used in the intro but later the term \"ablation\" is used.\n- Typo/word choice near \"with none word overlap\".\n- Typo/grammar near \"there are works (...) disprove\" - Suggestion of 3.3, point 2 is unclear. Adversarial examples can be highly confident and I suspect   means of incorporating confidence can themselves be subverted adversarially.\n- Figure 6 is not useful. I presume the paths are supposed to be indicative of model behaviour but   as mentioned in earlier comments, defining it is a crucial problem in explanation work. The   Figure is suggestive of it being a triviality.\n- Several points in the paper use phrases like \"A lot of works ...\" or \"most existing methods ...\". \n  I think it would be more appropriate to list the works or methods instead of noting the relative   abundance.\n- There are some inconsistencies in the notation for AOPC and the k parameter with potential   related typos in its definition.\n- Potential grammar issue near \"can be seen as an attribution\".\n- Grammar issue near \"results are mainly depend\" - Grammar issue near \"achieve 86.4% accuracy\" - Where is footnote 1?\n- In Figure 4, the resulting attributions for the target word \"good\" in LOO, Marg are not   presented or indicated by color.\nReferences from comments: [a] - Wang et al. \"Interpreting Interpretations: Organizing Attribution Methods by Criteria\".

Note that in Eq(1-3), every input of the Triaffine function would be fed into an MLP layer firstly, which is NONLINEAR.  Hence the coefficients \\beta_{i, j, g, r} cannot be extracted to the front (in Eq. 13).  The authors said that Eq. (11) can be decomposed to Eq. (12-13) in L277-278, which is WRONG, and so do Eq.(23-28) in Appendix B.  As a consequence, some ablation studies may not faithfully reflect the advantage of the Triaffine function as the decomposition does not hold mathematically - Triaffine mechanisms are widely used. Extending them to heterogeneous factors is somewhat trivial.  Hence technical contributions and novelties are limited.  First, I do not think boundary tokens are heterogeneous to inside tokens. Using an attention mechanism to compute the weight of each token within the span and using their weighted sum to represent the span, known as attention-pooling [1], has been explored before. [ 2] systematically compare different span representations in different tasks. They find that attention-pooling span representation performs the best in NER ( better than end-point representation, i.e. the baseline model of this work), but has a lower performance in many other tasks. So the result of this work is not surprising, since the authors also use attention-pooling to tackle (nested) NER, except that they replace the naive attention with the triaffine attention mechanism. After obtaining the span representation, it is often to concatenate the boundary token representations to the span representation and feed them to an MLP classifier for labeling. The authors use another triaffine instead. The really exciting part of this work is to use triaffine to fuse information from other related spans. To overcome the large computational complexity, the authors propose to (1) prune span, which is often used. ( 2) use decomposition, but the derivation is wrong as I discussed before. Finally, as other reviewers mentioned, this paper does not raise novel issues.\n[1] What do you learn from context? Probing for sentence structure in contextualized word representations.

The authors observe that while much progress has been made on automatic evaluation metrics, NLG modeling papers often still report very old metrics like BLEU and ROUGE. The Billboard is an attempt to bring the best practices of the metrics and modeling communities into one place. Generation models submitted to the Billboard would automatically get evaluated on new metrics as they are submitted, and a global ensemble metric (chosen to maximize correlation with human judgments) would also update as metrics are submitted, thus updating the ranking of generation systems. The paper presents Billboards for translation, summarization, and image captioning, as well as initial results on which metrics contribute most to the best ensemble metric.\nThis is an excellent idea and I think could be very impactful for the community. The paper is well-written and thorough, for example conducting a meta-analysis of which human annotations to use when learning the global ensemble metric.

While I acknowledge the clear advantages of this, particularly related to sample size, I would encourage the authors to also include system-level scores in the leaderboard. Ultimately, in the other half of the leaderboard, metrics will be used to make system-level comparisons. Even if there is high instance-level correlation, there could be different patterns at the system-level, for example if a metric has a small but consistent bias for or against a particular system's outputs. I wonder if perhaps there is some sort of compromise way to rank metrics that incorporates both instance-level and system-level scores. ",

    "paper_summary": "Authors propose augmenting the Knowledge Grounded Conversation (KGC) models by incorporating personal memory to produce persona-consistent responses in given context. Grounding responses in knowledge and personal memory makes those responses knowledgeable and personalized which is desirable.\nAuthors follow the standard approach of knowledge/memory selection, followed by response generation. In this paper they focus on knowledge/memory selection. They posit that knowledge selection is dependent on memory selection and memory is selected based on the context. They introduce two latent mappings: 1. Forward mapping from personal memory to external knowledge and 2. Inverse mapping of knowledge to personal memory. The authors present a variational inference based method to learn these mappings without access to explicit supervision. They set up a dual learning problem where the forward and inverse mappings are additionally informed by the produced response and learn from each other.\nAuthors also collected an appropriate corpus for this task which will be released to the community. They have conducted automatic and human evals and compared the proposed approach to existing baselines in both tasks (i.e., personalized dialogue response generation and knowledge grounded response generation). The proposed approach is shown to be significantly better than the baselines. Overall evaluation is well conducted and has meaningful comparison although a more intuitive explanation of differences (specifically compared to KnowledGPT + M) would be helpful.\nAuthors have also presented ablation studies that prove the value of each component. It’s interesting to see that modeling knowledge selection as a dependent process on memory selection results in significantly improved results. Although, the same results question the utility of dual learning and it should be discussed in more detail. ",

This should be valuable to the research community. ",

Instead of limiting the word alignment model training to parallel text (bitext), the authors follow the line of work which exploits multi-parallel corpora, which enables recovering missing alignments between a source and a target language. For this, the authors leveraged the community detection (CD) algorithm for graph, which makes the sub-graph within a community complete and while disconnecting inter-community edges, for training data labels.\nThe GNN proposed in the paper takes as input the node features which take into account the graph structure, community membership, and content embeddings which include word, position, and language. To optimize the resulting alignment edges, the authors propose two strategies to post-process the alignments based on the grow-diag-final-and employed in the statistical MT alignment, Thresholding GDFA (TGDFA) and TGDFA+orig ",
    "strengths": "The approach of multi-parallel word alignment (MPWA) is interesting not only because word alignment has largely been not worked on since the advent of neural machine translation (NMT) and only recently resurfaced, but also because of the growing interest of interpretable neural network models, which the current NMT does not really have. In addition, the SMT word alignment also benefits low-resource languages for which parallel or even monolingual corpora are not adequate.\nThe experimental result shows that the proposed graph neural network (GNN) approach outperforms the strong statistical word alignment baseline and prior graph-based and matrix-based approaches in terms of the overall alignment error rate and F1. ",
    "weaknesses": "Although the paper is interesting and strongly supported by experimental results, understanding the details is tough. For one, the difference between TGDFA+orig and TGDFA is not very clear in what is meant by the original bilingual GDFA. An illustration (page limit permitting) may be helpful to understand the difference.\nIt is unclear if HELFI training set uses 3 languages or 84 as listed in the appendix. ",
    "comments": "Apart from the concerns above, it is better to have some insights on how more other language pairs not in the test set correlates with increased performance. This can be achieved by experimental setups which include or exclude other languages not in the test set. For example, in HELFI, there can be one setup which includes only Finnish, Greek, and Hebrew and another that includes all the 84 languages in the Appendix A. The Appendix A is awkward as the section heading is not in one page with the entire content, which can be achieved by the typesetting. ",

The dataset annotated 4 types of punctuations, i.e. comma, period, question, and exclamation for live streaming video transcripts. The use of live streaming video transcripts poses new and interesting challenges compared to existing datasets in which  punctuation restoration is included as a sub-task of automatic speech recognition. Some of the challenges include the presence of more speakers, less formal and more spontaneous speech, and presence of frequent emotional sentences that need to be marked by exclamation marks. The dataset is annotated by experienced annotators. The authors have evaluated the state-of-the-art punctuation restoration models (neural based BiLSTM and graphical based CRF) and found that the performance of the PR models on their data set is far below compared to existing datasets revealing its challenging nature. Adding data augmentation brought slight changes in the performance. When these models were tested for domain adaptation i.e. training on existing datasets and testing on proposed dataset it was found that performance of all the models degrade significantly. They have also evaluated the performance of existing NLP toolkits for the task sentence splitting on this dataset and found that they perform very poorly suggesting the importance of this kind of training data.

Further study of this problem is very important.\nThis paper also reveals how existing NLP toolkits fail in the simple task of sentence boundary identification without the availability of proper punctuation.

I worry that this dataset, coming from such a narrow domain, will only be helpful for building models for that domain, which isn't particularly useful for wider applications of NLP.  At the very least, I would like to see some experiments using models trained with the Behance dataset on other domains as test sets. It would also be helpful to have a deep dive into the existing datasets to help the reader understand how exactly the Behance dataset differs (summary statistics as well as illustrative qualitative examples). It may also be good to add in more diverse sources of spontaneous speech to go beyond the design domain, such as YouTube videos or Spotify podcasts.\nThe agreement score of 0.59 seems low for punctuation restoration. How does it compare to previous annotation efforts on the other datasets. The paper says \"Toward the end, the annotators are allowed to discuss to make the final version of the dataset\" [line 154] but no details are given on how the annotators come to an agreement.

Ideally, one should be able to use the same model/architecture for all of the tasks in the benchmark by training it on their corresponding training sets. However, these two tasks feel lower level than the other tasks probably better handled somewhat separately than others.  3) Are there any reasons behind the selected baselines?

This method improves the performance of both BART and PEGASUS models. ",
    "strengths": "1. Trustworthy in abstractive text summarization is a very important topic. The method proposed in the paper would help evaluate whether or not to use and deploy summarization systems, and to introduce an \"unanswerability\" function when the system is unsure about the summary that it produced.\n2. The proposed method also improves the performance, which is an added benefit to introduce uncertainty. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. Since the focus of the paper is model trustworthiness, it would be nice to have more analyses and less (or no) focus on the model performance. That is, it would be nice to have more model comparisons (aside from BART and PEGASUS and including state-of-the-art models), more datasets (different domains, multi-document vs single-document, etc.), and most importantly factuality evaluations.\n2. The novelty of the proposed method is also very limited. This work is basically an application of the MC dropout to text summarization, and I find that there isn't a technical difficulty to apply such in text generation models. This also relates to the first weakness -- since the novelty is limited, readers would expect more analyses with regards to trustworthiness in summarization systems. Also, as stated in the paper, [1] already have used MC dropout in MT, which is also a text generation problem similar to text summarization. In fact, Section 3.2 is inspired from [1] and is only extended very marginally.\n3. The paper mentions [2] as related work that focused on uncertainty for summarization. However, no comparison is made between this and the proposed method on the effectiveness to measure uncertainty. Moreover, Section 5.1 and Figure 1 do not evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness to measure uncertainty. There should be a baseline method, such as [2], and a metric that measure such effectiveness. Instead, Figure 1 just shows if the summarization systems are more certain than the other.\n4. Finally, in Section 3.3, the \"predictive mean\", which is to select the summary with the lowest disagreement, seems to be very simple. Simple is not bad, but I think there can be smarter ways to ensemble multiple predictions from a summarization system. For example, the method used in [3] is one possible way. There should have been an exploration (or at least an ablation) to compare different possible techniques to do \"predictive mean\", especially since selecting a summary is far from taking a mean.\n[1] Wat zei je?

Specifically, they aim to use uncertainty measures to identify unanswerable questions based on the probability distribution of the answer choices provided. They use ReColr MRC dataset for their experiments. First, they create a data variation that replaces one of the choices with 'None of the Above' to create a dataset with 25% unanswerable questions. Then, they perform experiments with Electra PLM using expected entropy over the answer choices as the metric that measures uncertainty. First, they show that under a harsh negative-penalty (3:5) for wrong answers, abstaining from answering a certain amount of questions improves the overall performance. They observe that it doesn't really help in case of more common/usual negative penalty schemes such as 3:1. Then, they use the data manipulation to train explicit and implicit models to see if the uncertainty measure would help the implicit model perform reasonably in comparison to the explicit model. They observe that the implicit model shows some meaningful gains over a weaker MAP model.

It would be interesting to see, whether the reported results pertain across different datasets. For example CosmosQA (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00277.pdf) comes with built-in unanswerable questions. This work should be mentioned. \n - While most of the results are clear, I had difficulties interpreting the figures. What makes it difficult is that they all have different axes and threshold over different values. I believe compacting section 2 that discusses the high-level overview of the MC-MRC task to create more room for more thorough explanations of the results would be beneficial. This could be done by providing more informative captions of the figures or linking back to the equations and introduced names (e.g. beta). ",
    "comments": "What follows are some minor remarks, questions and comments: - The hyperparameter section is rather terse. It is not clear which hyper-parameters are selected from. Appropriate information should be added, at least in the appendix.\n- What is \"Fraction unanswerable\" in Figure 5 and how is it obtained?\n- I don't believe it is fair to make the comparison in Table 4. While the manuscript acknowledges that, it does not mention the precise nature of the unfairness. The point is that for MAP, the %UNANS is based on model predictions, it's not a parameter that can be freely chosen, unlike the Implicit method. Here, the dev-mixed set was used both for reporting the final accuracy comparison and to select the best %UNANS threshhold for implicit. It would be more fair to either estimate %UNANS from the training data (i.e. 25%) or to split the DEV-mixed in half, use one half to estimate the best %UNANS threshhold and the other half to compare Implicit with the chosen threshhold to MAP. This wouldn't change much of the argument as from what I can tell from Figure 5, Implicit is still better than MAP with %UNANS of 25. ",

ReClor is augmented to contain four variations of the same content/question/answer-choice triplets but with three versions of the same triplet containing a \"None of the above\" answer choice.  Then ELECTRA is modified to produce confidence scores for its answer selections using one of several metrics, the best-performing of which is expected entropy. ",
    "strengths": "The authors of this paper are correct in that most multiple-choice data sets like these don't include a \"None of the above\" option, and that most standardized tests, especially those that are adaptive (e.g. GRE) don't penalize test-takers for not answering a given question.  In order to mimic that, data sets need uncertainty built into them, which can be provided using the augmentation strategy here, if needed. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper introduces a new corpus of error-annotated sentences for grammatical error correction for Chinese. The dataset is composed of a subset of sentences from three different sources which were corrected by humans. The dataset contains multiple correction references for each erroneous sentence and is split into development and test in an attempt to standardise evaluation. The authors also make a case that character-based evaluation is better suited than word-based evaluation for Chinese GEC and carry out experiments with different systems on their new dataset using this approach.  This is the second revision of the paper that I have been asked to review. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the authors took my previous review into account and addressed as many of my points as possible in this new version. The paper has been thoroughly revised and is now much clearer and comprehensive, adding further clarifications and new experiments which include ensemble models.

Is it just to make sure that all ocurrences of the same types of errors are handled equally by all annotators? Weren't they free to correct the sentences in any way they wanted as you stated in lines 178-180?\n6) Line 264: \"We attribute this to our strict control of the over-correction phenomenon.\" What do you mean exactly? The original annotation considered some sentences to be erroneous while your guidelines did not?\n7) Line 310: \"Since it is usually ...\" This is not a well-formed sentence.

As it stands, it sounds as if you only kept the incorrect sentences without their corrections. You might want to make this clearer.\n9) \"... which does not need error-coded annotation\". This is not exactly so. ERRANT computes P, R and F from M2 files containing span-level annotations. For English, it is able to automatically generate these annotations from parallel text using an alignment and edit extraction algorithm. In the case of Chinese, you did this yourself. So while it is not necessary to manually annotate the error spans, you do need to extract them somehow before ERRANT can compute the measures.\n10) Table 5: \"For calculating the human performance, each submitted result is considered as a sample if an annotator submits multiple results.\" I am afraid this does not clearly explain how human performance was computed. Each annotator against the rest? Averaged across all of them? How are multiple corrections from a single annotator handled?  If you compared each annotation to the rest but the systems were compared to all the annotations, then I believe human evaluation is an underestimation. This is still not clear.\n11) Line 514: \"The word-order errors can be identified by heuristic rules following Hinson et al.

The authors utilize normalizing flows to model the sentence representations in a flexible space as transformed from a (shared between languages) simple base distribution. At translation time the invertibility of normalizing flows can be used to map between sentence representations in different languages. In experiments the authors test the methods' viability on many language pairs and show competitive performance across the board. ",

It would be good to report averages over multiple runs and report some more modern metrics as well like COMET or BLEURT.\n- It is initially quite unclear from the writing where the sentence-level representations come from. As they are explicitly modeled, they need supervision from somewhere. The constant comparison to latent variable models and calling these sentence representations latent codes does not add to the clarity of the paper. I hope this will be improved in a revision of the paper. ",

Overall, the proposed approach makes substantial improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods. For example, Micro F1 improves over BERTMeSH from 0.685 to 0.745. Similar improvements are also found for the example-based measures (e.g., example-based F1). Furthermore, a comprehensive ablation study was performed, showing that the label feature model has the largest impact on model performance, yet, other parts of the method still impact performance substantially. ",

It is neither easy nor trivial to make such considerable performance improvements for MeSH indexing, especially for Micro F1. For instance, BERTMeSH [1] only improves DeepMeSH [2] by only 2% in Micro F1 [1] after five years of work. Hence, seeing a Micro F1 near 0.75 is a huge breakthrough.\nReferences: [1] Peng, Shengwen, et al. \"DeepMeSH: deep semantic representation for improving large-scale MeSH indexing.\" Bioinformatics 32.12 (2016): i70-i79.\n[2] You, Ronghui, et al. \"BERTMeSH: deep contextual representation learning for large-scale high-performance MeSH indexing with full text.\" Bioinformatics 37.5 (2021): 684-692.

    "weaknesses": "Overall, there are three major weaknesses in this paper.\nFirst, the paper uses a custom training and validation dataset pulled from PubMed, making comparisons difficult. Using the data from the yearly BioASQ shared tasks would be better to use their data so new methods are more easily comparable. I understand this is common in similar studies (e.g., by BERTMeSH [3]), but a standardized dataset seems possible and useful.\nSecond, while the hyperparameters are discussed, it is not clear whether hyperparameters were optimized for the baseline models. What were the chosen parameters? Was the validation dataset used to optimize them similarly to the proposed method? If so, why is the standard deviation not reported for the baseline models (e.g., in Table 1)? Given the substantial performance differences between the proposed model and prior work, this additional information must be reported to ensure fair comparisons.\nThird, while this may be the first paper to use GCNNs for MeSH indexing, it is widely used for similar biomedical text classification tasks (e.g., ICD Coding). For instance, [1] directly combines BiLSTMs with GCNNs and label features in a very similar manner to the method proposed in this paper, albeit with exceptions such as [1] does not use dilated CNNs. Furthermore, that work has been expanded on to better understand the impact of the GCNNs and whether they are needed [2]. Hence, the paper would substantially help if the related work sections were expanded to include citations with similar methodologies.

    "paper_summary": "This paper describes an advancement in counterfactual probes that test whether neural nets make use syntactic information. The goal of counterfactual probes is show that models actually use syntactic info rather than just encoding it. The paper identifies a potential problem in previous work (summarized neatly in Fig. 1), namely that information may be encoded redundantly, and the probe may attend to the wrong redunant representation relative to the model itself, thus underestimating the presence/utility of the information. They solve this by introducing a dropout probe. ",
    "strengths": "The paper is overall clear in identifying the problem, though I wish they had described what a counterfactual probe was more clearly and earlier than they did (2.2), and I believe from the paper that they have solved the particular problem that they set out to: the issue of probes missing redundantly encoded information. ",
    "weaknesses": "My main concern is that they haven't quite demonstrated enough to validate the claim that these are demonstrating a causal role for syntactic knowledge. Two crticisms in particular: 1) The dropout probe improves sensitivity. It finds a causal role for syntactic representations where previous approaches would have missed it. Good. But all other things being equal, one should worry that this also increases the risk of false positives. I would think this should be a substantial part of the discussion.  2) Relating to the possibility of false positives, what about the probe itself? The counterfactual paradigm assumes that the probe itself is capturing syntactic structure, but I worry that training on templates could allow both the probe and the model to \"cheat\" and look for side information. Templates exacerbate this problem by presenting a relatively invariant sentence string structure.\nFinally, there's the possiblity that syntactic structure (or not quite, see point 2)) is encoded and plays some causal role in the model's predictions, but it's secondary to some other information.\nReally, the criticism comes down to a lack of baselines. How do we know that this approach isn't now overestimating the causal role of syntax in these models? Testing with a clearly non-syntactic proble, destroying syntax but keeping lexical effects by scrambling word order, or probing a model that certainly cannot encode this information. This is most of the way towards being an excellent paper, but it drops the ball in this respect. ",

    "paper_summary": "The authors entertain the hypothesis that syntactic information is redundantly encoded in neural language models, which has two important implications for probing and causal analysis: 1. Probes may arbitrarily choose one place a syntactic property is encoded, and the model may choose another. \n2. Changing a representation based on a probe may therefore only partially change whether the property is encoded in the model, and might not influence the model decision, even if the model is relying on syntax.\nFor contributions, the authors show first that syntactic information is redundantly encoded in language models, based on estimates of mutual information between different parts of the embeddings. They then propose a simple method to make probing more robustly rely on all the information in the representation, by adding dropout to the probe. They show that this leads to altered representations that are more influential on changing the model's behavior. ",
    "strengths": "1. Well-written and clear hypothesis: redundant encoding of syntactic information poses a problem for drawing conclusions about whether models rely on the syntactic information encoded by probes.\n2. The authors show that different parts of the hidden representations in different trained networks redundantly encode information correlated with syntax.\n3. The dropout method for addressing this issue is both simple and motivated, which makes it appealing.\n4. The experimental results, in the case of the QA models, tell a different story than past work that suffered from the redundancy vulnerability. Specifically, this work finds evidence that QA models do rely on syntactic information, while past work suggested they didn't. In the case of NLI, this work agrees with past works in finding a negative result. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. There is some imprecision in the discussion of the results in 4.2.2: “In contrast to the standard probes, the dropout probes, plotted in the right column, revealed much larger effects of syntactic interventions.” Is this conclusion really justified? Visually, it is not clear that the red line is “above” the green line any more with dropout than without. Rather, it may just have more variance (so more causal influence, but maybe not in the right direction). In any case, the clean summary you give here seems at odds with the trend in the figure, and should be made more precise.\n2. There may be some issue with the counterfactual intervention experiment with NLI-HANS, if I understand that part correctly. In 4.3, if the NLI-HANS model is already at 99% performance, why would you expect its accuracy to change significantly after counterfactual modification? You are already very close to the ceiling, and it should be hard to see any benefit of the intervention.\n3. “ First, we found that language models redundantly encoded syntactic information in their embeddings” — Section 4.1 seems like solid evidence that networks redundantly encode information that is informative about syntax. But, to be a bit pedantic, it doesn’t have to be syntactic information; if $D$ is highly correlated with something non-syntactic, then that property could be expressed redundantly, and the MI would still be high. If we believe that there are dataset artifacts in syntactic parsing, then this is a concern. ",
    "comments": "It seems to me that redundancy may only be a problem for the specific gradient-based representation alteration method you consider, rather than other ways of producing counterfactual interventions. For example, would [AlterRep](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06965) automatically handle the issue of redundancy?\n417: why is “as” included along with “were” and “are”?\n295: What do you mean by “conservative but tight estimate of mutual information”?

More specifically:    * I assume that character-level MT would be more beneficial for languages with logographic writing systems (e.g. Chinese) than the ones that use alphabets. My understanding is that the WMT shared task language pairs are skewed towards European languages: if that is the case, I think the shared task analysis could have considered more venues, e.g. CWMT, The Workshop on Asian Translation, or IWSLT 2020 Open Domain Translation task (ja-zh, 20M training sentences). In any case, I think the paper should have listed the WMT languages and discussed if the use/mention of character-level methods varies by language, script, or morphological patterns.\n    * The empirical evaluation on the WMT dataset is also only performed on European languages (English, German, and Czech). In the smaller experiments, which were used for model selection, character-level models outperform subword-level ones on English-Arabic translation; this aligns with the findings of Shaham and Levy (2020), who attribute it to non-concatenative morphology of Semitic languages. So I am left wondering if the conclusions would have been different if the larger-data evaluation included languages with non-concatenative morphologies.\n2. This might be beyond the scope of the paper, but I am also wondering if the same conclusions extend to unsupervised and semi-supervised cases (for details, see the following section). ",
    "comments": "- I am wondering if the conclusions about the performance gap between character-level and subword-level models apply to unsupervised MT. For example, character-level FSTs for unsupervised translation between closely related languages (e.g. Serbian and Bosnian) perform very well [1]. An unsupervised subword-level neural MT model for the same task tested demonstrates very poor results [2], but training the same model with character-level tokenization yields a great improvement [3].\n- I think that the process of selecting the best-performing model in a smaller experiment and then evaluating it extensively is reasonable, but I am wondering if evaluating the two rejected models, CANINE and Charformer, in terms of robustness could have given other interesting insights. I understand that evaluating all types of models on the larger dataset might not be feasible, but maybe the robustness testing could somehow be included in the smaller-data experiments too?\n- I might be missing something, but I could not figure out if the results for the proposed two-step decoding method are reported anywhere in the paper. Are the results in Table 1 with decoder downsampling obtained with or without the two-step method? If without, then how much worse does the two-step method perform?\n- Table 2 is not colorblind-friendly (red-green is the most common type of colorblindness). I would suggest changing the colors and/or specifying in the caption that the top number in each cell corresponds to chrF and the bottom one to COMET.\n- In Table 3, en-cs BPE to character results are missing the recall on lemmas/forms seen in training.\n[1] Pourdamghani, Nima, and Kevin Knight. \" Deciphering related languages.\" EMNLP 2017.\n[2] He, Junxian, et al. \"A Probabilistic Formulation of Unsupervised Text Style Transfer.\" ICLR 2019.\n[3] Ryskina, Maria, et al. \"Comparative Error Analysis in Neural and Finite-state Models for Unsupervised Character-level Transduction.\" SIGMORPHON 2021.

    "paper_summary": "This paper is about character-level machine translation. The first part is a survey of 1) existing methods to enhance character-level translaiton and 2) methods used for WMT submissions in the past. The second part are experiments on character-level MT that compare different ways of encoding and decoding sequences of characters. ",
    "strengths": "1) Comprehensive literature review: - I believe that the survey of existing literature is very comprehensive and covers most important works in this area. This survey in itself is valuable for the MT research community.\n2) Experiments have reasonable methodology: - In my opinion, the techniques that are compared (e.g. Lee-style, Canine, etc.) are adequately chosen.\n- The evaluation procedures (choice of metrics, several training runs to report variance, confidence intervals) are also adequate.\n- I think that the large systems trained on WMT data for EN-CS and EN-DE are representative of the capabilities of current systems.\n3) The findings are novel and actionable: - The paper does indeed provide novel evidence for why WMT submissions rarely have character-level systems.\n- While previous works have claimed that character-level MT has higher domain robustness, this paper shows that this is not the case, and the findings are backed up by more reliable data.\n- A further general conclusion is that most works on char-level MT focused on enhancing encoding, while decoding is under-explored. I think that is a reasonable and straightforward suggestion for future work. ",
    "weaknesses": "1) Questionable usefulness of experiments on small datasets - As the paper itself states in the beginning, a possible weakness of earlier works is that their experiments were conducted on small datasets. In such cases it is unclear whether conclusions also apply to current MT systems trained on large datasets.\n- This criticism also applies to this paper under review, since many experiments are conducted using IWSLT data. I would like the paper to at least acknowledge this weakness.\n- It is questionable whether the outcome of the IWSLT experiments can be used to sub-select experimental conditions to try on the larger WMT data sets.\n2) The paper is too dismissive of MBR decoding, without much evidence - The paper implies that MBR is always worse than other decoding methods and that \"beam search with length normalization is the best decoding algorithm\".\n- I would change the wording to be more careful about describing the MBR results. Sampling-based MBR decoding is very new in MT and has a lot of potential to be more optimized in the future. It is simply not well optimized yet. For instance, very recent published works such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09388 show that MBR improves considerably if a learned metric like COMET is used as the utility function for MBR.\n- I also take issue with this sentence: \"Sampling from character-level models leads to very poor translation quality that in turn also influences the MBR decoding that leads to much worse results than beam search.\" I believe that the quality of sampling is not necessarily indicative of the ability of MBR to pick a good translation from a pool of samples. ",
    "comments": "1) Suggestion for the general literature review: - The only kind of work I would add are proposals to learn an ideal segmentation (instead of fixing the segmentation before starting the training). One paper I think would make sense is: https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~sokolov/pubs/kreutzer18learning.pdf (also has character-level MT in the title).\n2) Questions: - How many samples are the \"sample\" results in Table 2 based on? I believe this could be a point estimate of just 1 random sample. It is expected that the quality of one sample will be low, but the variance will also be very high. It would be better to show the mean and standard deviation of many samples, or at least clarify how exactly this result is produced.\n3) Figures and presentation: - I believe that the color scheme in tables is confusing at times. In Table 1, I think it is confusing that a deeper shade of red means better results. In Table 2 it is non-intuitive that the first row is CHRF and the second row is COMET - and the table is quite hard to read.\n4) Typos: - \"and thus relatively frequent occurrence of out-of-vocabulary tokens.\" - a word is missing here - \"The model shrinks character sequences into less hidden states\" -> \"fewer hidden states\" - \"does not apply non-linearity\" -> \"does not apply a non-linearity\" ",

In addition, the paper proposes insights on the selection of the source language when transferring to a target language of little or no annotated data. Moreover, the authors promise the release of 65 fine-tuned language models.

The pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model is taken as the backbone, fine-tuned on one source language with a large enough training set (65 source languages) and then tested on target languages (105 languages). The results show that there can be various factors that influence the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer, like pre-training inclusion, language families, etc. Further analyses and discussions over the influencing factors are also included.

There can be too many influencing factors, some of which are explored in this work, while some others might also be important, such as training data size, quality of annotation, etc. Especially, when looking at the source languages, it seems that a large portion of them belong to Indo-European, which may make the overall results biased. Maybe it would be nice to explore a small subset of languages from different language families.\nIt seems that \"pretraining-inclusion\" is a major predictor, which may be not surprising. Nevertheless, there might be a hidden factor inside: if a certain language is not included in the pre-training, the vocabulary of the pre-training model might not even have items for the words in this language, which might be split into strange pieces by the subword segmenter. In addition, source-target vocabulary overlapping may be another important factor to look at. I think there should be more exploration and analysis in these aspects. ",

It is also not surprising that most long-form answers are consist of answer summary, auxiliary information, and examples. I did not find many motivating insights from the analysis that could potentially benefit the future work of long-form QA.  - Section 5 is good to me.

For example, analyzing how the discourse structure of long-form answers differs in different domains and in different question types.  - Make this paper a closed loop.

As shown in Figure 1, the audio branch is initialized from a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0, the visual branch is initialized from a pre-trained MoCo v2, and the two branches are fused before seq2seq+CTC decoding. Results on LRS2 show decent improvement over the recent E2E conformer Lip reading work. Ablation studies, noise-robustness, and low-resource AVSR are also helpful. The paper presentation and writings are also clear. However, there is limited novelty as utilizing self-supervised representations for AVSR has been done before. ",

The approach makes use of a teacher model based on query translation and monolingual IR in English. The student model is trained with two objectives. One is an IR objective to match the teacher model's query-passage relevance predictions. The second objective is to learn a representation of the non-english text that most closely matches the teacher's representation at the token level. This relies on a cross lingual token alignment based on greedily aligning tokens with the highest cosine similarity.

On the XOR-TyDi leaderboard, one of this paper's models is the current best. ",

    "paper_summary": "The authors describe a novel approach to Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). They propose a single-model-based approach. That is, in contrast with classical MT-based CLIR systems, where we can clearly distinguish two phases/stages/subprocesses involved (translation + monolingual retrieval), this is now solved altogether. For simplicity they have used English as the target language for their experiments. The results obtained show state-of-the-art performane according to their metrics.\nTheir proposal takes as basis a ColBERT IR architecture (with proved state-of-the-art performance) and a pre-trained multilingual masked language model (XML-RoBERTa in their experiments). The idea consists on using knowledge distillation (KD) to teach/fine-tune the underlying multilingual model to \"imitate\" the behavior (and, theoretically, the performance) of a monolingual IR system in the target language, even when the CLIR system is taking as input queries in source language, not the target language. This fine-tuning/training process is done in two phases.  A first KD process is focused on teaching the CLIR system to select and rank relevant documents in the same way as the target-language monolingual system. Ideally, the resulting fine-tuned [cross-language] model should be able to obtain the same output results as a monolingual model. In other words, we are teaching the system how to solve the retrieval part of the process. For this purpose, a regular CLIR dataset is needed (parallel queries and their corresponding relevant documents).\nThe second KD process is focused on teaching the CLIR system to encode (internally) a source-language text (e.g. the input query to the CLIR system) in the same way as the target-language monolingual system. Ideally, the resulting fine-tuned [cross-language] model should be able to generate the same internal representation of a text as the monolingual model even when they are taking as input texts (queries) in different languages (but being mutual translations, of course). In other words, we are teaching the system how to solve the translation part of the process. For this purpose, a parallel corpora is needed.  Logically, there are still two issues involved in the joint CLIR process (translation + retrieval), but they are now solved at a time after having teached the model how to do it.   The XOR-TyDi CLIR dataset (7 languages + English) is used for in-domain experiments, and the MKQA dataset (5 common languages with the previous one + English) is used for zero-shot experiments. For simplicity, English is always used as the target language. The following baselines, in increasing performance order, are used: (1) [bottom] ColBERT IR model + XML-RoBERTa multilingual masked language model, fine-tuned with English data       (2) ColBERT IR model + XML-RoBERTa multilingual masked language model, fine-tuned with both English and cross-language data  (3) [top] classical approach: MT + ColBERT IR model, fine-tuned with English data  The results obtained are clearly positive, notably outperforming the lower baselines and approaching the top monolingual state-of-the-art approach. An ablation study is also performed, proving that both KD processes actually contribute to the results. ",

    "comments": "- When reading the first part of the article, the authors tend to associate the term \"CLIR\" mainly with theirs and similar approaches, in contrast with the classical MT+monolingual IR approach. However, both of them are CLIR systems and this creates some confusion in the reader.  - Sect. 1 \"Introduction\" contains too many redundancies with respect to the rest of the paper. Taking into account the length of the paper and the Appendix, a reduction of Sect.1 through the removal of unnecessary redundancies would provide space enough to move part of the appendix back to tha main paper, thus making it more complete and self-contained.\n- l.166-181: No data are given here about the parallel corpus used for the term-level alignment. This is explained later, in the appendix, but no clue is given to the reader at this point. The authors should move that part back to the main paper or, at least, indicate that those data are provided in the Appendix. Apart from that, nothing is said about the size of the resultant dictionary.\n- Figure 2: It has not been useful at all, at least for me.\n- l.182-195: According to this, it seems that the resulting CLIR system proposed by the authors would be also able to work not only with queries in the source-language (i.e. non-English), but also with queries in the target-language (i.e. English). Is this the case or just a confusion?\n- Table 1: The reader must be able to easily identify which configuration described in the text corresponds with each raw, and this is not the case. This must be corrected.\n- I have some concerns about the (only) use of R@5kt as metric. Why no Precision-based metric is used? This information would be very useful to have a better view of the performance of the approach. Moreover, which criteria is used to count the tokens? Do you join the text of all the snippets retrieved and, then, you count 5000 tokens?\n- l.266-268: The authors are surprised about the fact that the contribution of the KD with parallel corpus is greater than that of IR triples. I think it makes much sense since you're using a Recall-based metric. Since it is a Recall-based metric, the important thing is that you retrieve the document, regardless of its ranking. In a CLIR context, a more accurate translation (e.g. being able to translate one more term of the input query) allows new matchings, thus improving recall, regardless of the ranking position where the new documents are retrieved.\n- References: They contain the usual missing-uppercases errors.\n- footnotes 3,4: When a reference to a footnote is inserted immediately before a punctuation mark, they should switch positions; e.g. \"(...) OPUS^3. The (...)\" --> \"(...) OPUS.^3 The (...)\"  - l.479-480: How many cases have been analyzed? ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper studies the routing fluctuation problem in the mixture of experts (MoE) Transformers: existing MoE methods assign the same input to different experts even when the training almost ends. This fluctuation hurts sample efficiency and leads to slower convergence.  It introduces a two-stage training routing strategy called StableMoE to stabilize the routing: first learns a lightweight and more balanced router via a balanced loss and the router distillation, then freezes the router for stable token-to-expert assignment for second-stage training that only has the task loss. The novelty is in the decoupled two-stage training strategy and the use of a stable routing strategy. The proposed balanced loss is not distinct from the one in Switch Transformer.\nExperimental results on language model and multilingual machine translation tasks show StableMoE achieves better performance than other MoE methods and converges faster. The ablation study further confirms the two-stage training stabilizes the routing and verify the effectiveness of StableMoE. It remains unclear whether the total budget for training (i.e. total compute resources) is smaller compared to exiting MoE methods. It also misses the inference speedup results. ",

The two losses are both encouraging the model to assign the tokens to experts in a more balanced way.  - The main results compare the training FLOPS, how about the total compute budget/costs for convergence? And also the inference speed is unclear.\n- For \"still uses original assignment scores as input, so the gate signal can also be learned in training stage 2\" (line 215 to 216), the routing strategy is fixed, so how the gate single could be also learned during stage 2?

Their approach is as follows:  1.) \tCreation of a within-document knowledge graph based on IE (“IE” is never defined. I assume it stands for information extraction)  2.) \tCreation of a cross-document knowledge graph, connecting each cross-document event cluster to “events in the cluster”  3.) \tConnection of document nodes with all events and entities in the document.\n4.) \tEncoding of cross-document knowledge graphs via graph neural networks and use of event and document level events to detect misinformation at both levels.

    "paper_summary": "This work tackles the automatic identification of human values in arguments. \nHuman values can provide the underlying motives behind arguments and can explain why someone takes a position or what goals the person sees as worth striving for. \nOpposing values or different ways of prioritizing these values lead to conflicts and disagreements. If the underlying values can be made explicit, valuable insights can be gained in the analysis of different discourses. In other contexts arguments can be automatically generated for a target audience based on appropriate matching values and thus be more convincing. This motivates the authors to tackle the task and initially address the following problems: they systematically evaluate existing taxonomies from social and psychological science. Based on this they develop a framework that integrates the values from the various theories and that provides different levels of granularity, thus making an automatic classification of these values more feasible. The framework is used to create a resource with arguments from different geographical regions annotated with human values. The authors conduct some classification experiments with transformer-based models and discuss the results in an analysis. ",
    "strengths": "The authors provide the following contributions: - a systematic literature review of existing theories about the classification of human values in argumentation - a theoretically-informed framework to annotate human values in arguments. Different levels of granularity provide flexibility for the annotation of new data and is useful to do automatic classification of human values, especially when data is scarce and the classes are imbalanced - a resource annotated with their new framework that is made accessible for the research community. The annotation process is described in detail. The resource contains arguments from different cultural regions.  - experiments for the automatic classification of human values using the new data set. These can serve as a baseline for future research and they provide some initial insights about the difficulty of the task and the robustness ",

It took me some time to understand that the schemata introduced in section 2.1 are also considered when designing the new taxonomy (Table 1), making this more explicit (already in section 2.1) would help to make this more clear. To me it is not clear how the beginning of section 3 (claim 1: human values are implicit, claim 2: human values make arguments more persuasive, claim 3: the implicit connection has to me made explicit) provide justifications for the new design. To me the motivation for the proposed taxonomy is a) that it combines different theories therefore is more complete, missing values have been added and b) that is has different levels of granularity which is useful for both, quantitative analyses and machine learning. Although this was hinted at in the introduction, I am missing the clear motivation / advantages for the new taxonomy in this section. \nOn top of that there is a missing reference that is relevant, as it tackles the automatic classification of human values using the Schwartz taxonomy (though in social media and using feature-based approaches, no Deep Learning): A Societal Sentiment Analysis: Predicting the Values and Ethics of Individuals by Analysing Social Media Content (https://aclanthology.org/E17-1069.pdf) ",

    "paper_summary": "The paper introduces a dataset targeted at computational argumentation, more specifically at implicit assumptions which are often involved in premises supporting arguments. Such implicit assumptions, labelled as “human values” in the paper and in the social sciences, are shared beliefs regarding the positive assessment of some dimension, e.g., “having a comfortable life is good”, “being polite is good”, etc. The dataset released with the paper contains 5270 English arguments annotated with a 54-level taxonomy of human values, which is  organized hierarchically and covers four geographical cultures (USA, China, India, Africa). The release is complemented by modeling experiments which set the baseline for future work on the data.\nThe main strengths of the paper are in 1) the novelty of the dataset and the fine-grained taxonomy it adopts, 2) the interdisciplinary nature of the adopted taxonomy, and 3) the size and coverage (for the U.S. part).  The main weaknesses are 1) the cursory description of the annotation schema, 2) the need for a more detailed discussion of the modeling results (what works, what doesn’t), 3) the lack of ground for cross-cultural generalization which is claimed as a contribution.  For these reasons, I consider the paper good but, acceptance-wise, I am not fully convinced by in its current version. I recommend the authors address the points summarized above and discussed below, and I look forward to read the next version of the paper, either as a resubmission or in its final version if it is accepted. ",
    "strengths": "- As a strong supporter of the introduction of interdisciplinary work in NLP, I really liked the theoretical motivation behind the paper. Moreover, when it comes to computational argumentation, I believe such implicit assumptions like the ones at the core of the paper are of enormous relevance and still a bottleneck in the NLP/Argument Mining handling of real-world data.\n- I also strongly appreciate the fine-grainedness of the adopted taxonomy and the annotation effort it required.  - The US subset, which covers the vast majority of the dataset, is indeed very large and commonly employed in Argument Mining, allowing for robust generalization. ",
    "weaknesses": "- Precisely because the annotation is the major contribution of the dataset, I would have expected a more structured discussion of its different layers. Figure 1, in the Introduction, is extremely complex and not discussed at all. Similarly, Table 1 is incredibly rich and the text of section 3 basically focusses on the comparison between the adopted annotation schema and previous work/theories that the NLP reader is not supposed to be familiar with.  - The modeling results, albeit meant as baseline experiments to accompany the dataset, should have been discussed more thoroughly. What is the effect of frequency of a specific annotated human value on the performance in modeling it? Besides excluding the extremely rare human value from the test set, was the sampling of training/development/test also conducted taking care of the general distribution of the categories?  - I believe that the cross-cultural claim put forward by the authors should be smoothened for two reasons: 1) not only the non US subsets are very small, but the sample of users who writes on English forums cannot be considered representative of the culture of the respective geographical locations; 2) even bypassing 1, the authors do not provide any discussion of the distribution of values in the 4 involved geographic locations — which is what I was very much looking forward to as a reader, since the onset of the paper. ",
    "comments": "- Write-up: The contextualization provided in 2.2 would benefit from examples of the comparison terms (framing in the Entman sense; framing in the Argument Mining sense) and by more explicit connections between those argumentation schemes and the ones adopted in the datasets. E.g., care in moral foundation theory, Benevolence: caring in the dataset).  - Modeling: BERT is multi-label, SVM multi-class. Can the authors elaborate on how this (paired with the skewed frequency coming with the high-granular dataset) affects the modeling?  - Conceptually: Human values are a phenomenon that has its own standing independently from argumentation. They are expected to vary across social groups, geographical locations, etc. The authors should probably acknowledge this explicitly, and I think they could make their motivation/contribution even stronger by reflecting on the gain of both sides of this interdisciplinary study. Human values can of huge interest for computational argumentation (main motivation of the paper). But what is the specific perspective/contribution that the focus on argumentative text can give on the study of human values? ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper presents AlephBERT, a BERT-based model trained on texts written in Hebrew, a morphologically rich language which is generally hard to model using methods that work well for languages such as English that don't have complex morphology. The authors train the model on a considerably larger corpus (about twice as large), which leads to gains on sentence-level sentiment analysis and token-level NER tasks. Further, the authors experiment with different methods for segmenting the input into morphemes and obtaining morpheme-level contextual representations. They show that a simple pipeline approach in which one first segments the tokens into morphemes using a character-based seq2seq model and then inputs the morpheme tokens into the AlephBERT model trained on the original tokens leads to stronger results than multi-task-learning approaches on a morpheme-level NER task. They also obtain SOTA results for Hebrew morpheme segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing. ",
    "strengths": "- Very strong results on a number of morphological, syntactic and shallow semantic tasks.\n- Detailed experiments using simple methods to obtain morpheme-level contextual representations.\n- The paper is well written and a pleasure to read.\n- Because of all the additional experiments that are only relevant for morphologically rich languages this is not a \"BERT for yet another language\" paper but provides interesting insights that are likely going to be very relevant for researchers and practitioners working with morphologically rich languages ",
    "weaknesses": "- I originally complained about the lack of an ethics statement given that the authors train their model on potentially problematic text from Twitter that has not been verified. The authors now added a paragraph to the main text that briefly touches upon this issue but I would rather like to see a proper ethics statement, so that this information is more visible than it currently is.\n- As also pointed out by other reviewers, the evaluation only happened for Hebrew and it is unclear how language-agnostic this method is in practice. It would be good to discuss that limitation in the conclusion of the paper.\n- A major contribution of this paper is adapting several existing Hebrew tasks to a comprehensive morphological/syntactic/shallow semantic benchmark. However, unless I missed something, this streamlined benchmark will not be released along with the paper and so if someone wanted to build a future LM, they would have to re-do all the work of adapting existing datasets.

I did not re-check all the details of the paper carefully, I mostly focused on checking the parts where I had reservations towards the previous version; I simply hope that the parts which I already found good in the previous version stayed good or were improved in this version. But I found already the previous version of the paper to be very good.*\nThe paper describes a model called AlephBERT, which is a BERT language model for Hebrew that surpasses previous such models thanks to being trained on larger data and with better handling of the morphological richness of Hebrew. The paper also compiles together an evaluation toolkit for evaluating Hebrew language models, based on pre-existing tasks and datasets. The model and all code is planned to be released with the camera-ready version of the paper.\nThe paper is definitely mostly a resource paper: most of the stuff is laborious but mostly straightforward, gathering data from available sources, training a model using existing approaches, compiling a benchmarking toolkit from existing tasks and datasets, and evaluating the trained model with this toolkit. The only part which is more research-heavy is handling the rich morphology of Hebrew, where the authors experiment with introducing a morphological segmentation component into the neural setup (a task which is highly non-trivial for Hebrew).\nThe authors evaluate all of their contributions and prove that each of them brings improvements over the previous state of the art. ",
    "strengths": "The resources created by the authors seem to be extremely useful for nearly anyone dealing with Hebrew in NLP, as large pretrained language models are the core of most current approaches.\nThe approach used for handling complex Hebrew morphology is novel and potentially inspirative for other morphologically complex languages.\nWhile I have a feeling that ACL does not prefer publishing pure resource papers, I believe that in case where the created resource is very useful, these papers should have their place at ACL. Besides, there is also a research component to the paper (although the research component itself would not suffice for a long paper).\nThe paper is very well written and very nice to read and easy to understand.

The authors explored 3 different variants of MSLR, showing that when optimal unimodal learning rates are close, “smooth” variant performs the best, and when optimal unimodal LRs are far apart, “keep” and “dynamic” variants are better. The authors also performed layer conductance analysis to validate the hypothesis about vanishing gradients, showing that MSLR leads to models with larger layer conductance values. ",

",
    "weaknesses": "1) It is unclear how one should do the smoothing of LR in the “Smooth” variant. The authors proposed some values in the reasonable range but without any discussion on how they are decided. It would be great if there is a methodical approach or a description of how this is done. \n2) Layer conductance is not a good way to measure vanishing gradients. It is a measure of neuron importance for a given input. While the result of conductance analysis is in the form of “gradients”, it is a different concept from the gradients the model receives during training. Hence, I would argue that the layer conductance analysis is actually not measuring what the authors aim to measure and the conclusions should be revised. \n3) MSLR requires knowing the unimodal optimal learning rates in advance - which means we have to spend resources to tune unimodal models and discard them in the end. It would be interesting to see how this compares to directly tuning a late-fusion model with separate LR for each modality, especially with a similar or less compute budget. ",
    "comments": "1) Relating to weakness 2), the authors need to properly measure gradients during training and validate their hypothesis about vanishing gradients, which would be easy to measure with norm of gradients. If the authors do not have the resources to conduct this analysis in time, I suggest the authors to revise their claims on vanishing gradients as layer conductance does not measure that. \n2) I suggest the authors to add a brief discussion about how to pick learning rates in the “Smooth” variant; 3) Typo - line 440, “...from the all the joint…” -> “...from all the joint…” 4) Typo - line 561, “while MSLR while achieves…” -> “while MSLR achieves…” ",

",
    "weaknesses": "1) I would have liked to have seen a better application domain motivation for why the OOV problem in NER is so important.  2) The paper has the following phrase explaining the problem that it wishes to address: “entail preventing the model from rote memorizing the entity names or exploiting biased cues via eliminating entity name information.” However, majority of the paper and indeed the method itself seems to then emphasis the following specific problem, i.e. “eliminating task-specific nuisances.” I think maybe the former line should then either be removed or somewhere it state whether it is a hypothesis of the authors that “eliminating task-specific nuisances” indeed means “preventing the model from rote memorizing the entity names or exploiting biased cues via eliminating entity name information.” Perhaps the authors would need another whole paper to analyze what “eliminating task-specific nuisances” w.r.t. the proposed approach precisely means. So I would not say this as a weakness of this paper. However, is the phrase “preventing the model from rote memorizing the entity names or exploiting biased cues via eliminating entity name information” is used, it would help the reader if a connection is made to the actual solution which is mostly referred to as “eliminating task-specific nuisances.”\n3) I also wonder if the authors would be willing to rephrase “nuisances” in “eliminating task-specific nuisances?” Maybe as “noise?”\n4) Table 4. Curious why the ablation results are not shown on the CONLL 2003 dataset even though the method seems to have a maximum impact on it? Further, the CONLL 2003 – OOV data in particular seems quite relevant in this experimental setting. Can the authors provide these results? Otherwise the empirical analysis would seem incomplete to me by missing a seeming very relevant detail.  5) Not a weakness of this work as such. But maybe as a suggestion for future work.

In fairness, Section 5.3 and Table 5 compare VG-trained Oscar with (probably) VG-free CLIP and don't see any large differences between the two, indicating that it's not the VG-in-training that is driving the differences between Bert and the multimodal models (and so more likely to be genre/domain differences, or the actual visual inputs, see point  1).\n3, The paper is missing a discussion of a lot of early related work that used e.g. McRae norms; e.g. Silberer et al (2013) and references therein.

It's not crystal clear to me about what the main topic of the paper is: Is that about reporting bias analysis, or do we mainly focus on probing visual commonsense? Although I saw authors trying to build relationship between the two topics. But for me, the two parts still seem a bit independent from each other. I may suggest that the work can focus on reporting bias *on top of* commonsense probing, i.e., commonsense probing can be just treated as an analysis tool to help you study the key reporting bias issues. \n4.

    "paper_summary": "This paper explores the effects of using a generative model that provides question prompts to human annotators in either the standard or adversarial data collection for training a QA model. The proposed approach combines the benefits of dynamic adversarial data collection, i.e. human annotators generating data points for the model and generative models that are traditionally used to augment datasets with adversarial data points. \nThis paper provides a thorough analysis of using Generative Annotation Assistants (GAAs) during data annotation process, examining the effects on annotation speedup, effectiveness in fooling the model, and performance improvement on downstream tasks. This paper collects data points from several experimental settings to compare the effects of sampling strategies, using model-in-the-loop (standard vs adversarial data collection), datasets used to train the GAAs, and whether answer prompts are provided or not. \nThis paper shows that the use of GAA without adversarial model in the loop is can achieve near-adversarial accuracy but at much higher speed of generating the adversarial dataset. Thus this paper addresses limitations of the adversarial data collection process, which is the large amount of time needed to collect the dataset. \nThis paper shows that use of GAA in both the standard and adversarial data collection helps improve model performance on downstream tasks. Additionally, in the standard data collection setting, GAA provides a measurable speedup in collecting the dataset in general, but also the effective examples that fool the model by a significant margin. \nDespite the exhaustive experimentation, all the experimental settings are done using one model-in-the-loop, one question prompt generator and 2 datasets of similar domains. This limitation has been called out in the paper. ",
    "strengths": "- The major takeaway is that the use of GAAs in the standard data collection process results in annotation efficiency, as measured by vMER, i.e. model error rate on the collected data, and time per model fooling example. Additionally, this results in significant improvement in model performance on downstream QA task, which is almost as performant as adversarial data collection without use of GAAs.\n- Authors demonstrate effectiveness of using GAAs by exploring effects on the adversarial data collection process as well. Speedup isn't observed here as much as the increase in downstream task performance.\n- Authors even experiment with providing answer prompts in addition to question prompts and observe a performance improvement on most downstream tasks for most of the experimental settings. So overall, providing answer prompts in addition to question prompts helps.\n- This is the first work to investigate the use of generative assistants for crowdworkers doing the data annotation.\n- This paper uses several experimental settings, albeit only few data points per setting to conduct the study.\n- The paper has clear language, explaining in detail all the components used in the experimental setup and evaluation strategy. This paper also provides the motivation behind the experimental settings which makes the objective of the exercise much clear. ",
    "weaknesses": "- This approach is compute-intensive as it requires pretraining of the GAA model on the same dataset as the QA model needs to be trained on. It assumes that the resultant GAA model is performant enough to provide meaningful prompts to annotators. If this assumption doesn't hold true, then it can result in larger annotation times, thus bringing into question the speedup claim of the proposed approach.\n- From table 3, it looks like using GAA with adversarial data collection hurts out-of-domain generalization, as seen by the dip in performance on MRQA dataset.\n- This approach has been tested only on the SQuAD dataset for all experimental settings, and just additionally MRQA for evaluation. While it is understandable that all these experimental settings require lot of time and human effort to conduct, the fact that this has been tested only on one dataset raises concerns about generalizability of this framework. Especially when use of GAAs seems to hurt performance on the out of domain dataset MRQA for adversarial data collection. So in situations where adversarial data collection cost doesn't matter as much as quality of resultant QA model, using GAAs won't work.\n- While some mild correlations emerge between sampling strategy and downstream performance, overall it seems like the best experimental setting in terms of a trade-off between annotation speed, efficiency and downstream performance depends highly on the downstream task at hand. Practically, its not feasible to try out all these experimental settings for data annotation for QA datasets for industrial/real-world applications. ",
    "comments": "- In the setting where annotators were provided with both the question and answer prompts, doesn't this limit the example diversity? This is referring to the drawbacks of generative models mentioned in the introduction section. I think maybe more data is needed to answer this. If we have some metrics showing how many times users accepted the suggestions by GAA, and if we see the most of the GAA suggestions were accepted, then it means that it is the GAA that is generating data points for the most part, with minimal human intervention.\n- In table 4, there is a spike in model performance in terms of annotation efficiency for likelihood sampling strategy in the Adversarial QA dataset. Such a trend was not seen for question prompts only setting, for both standard and adversarial data collection processes. Can you please provide a reason/explanation for this observation? ",

For example, EMR is stated to \"randomly stor[e] a few examples of old classes\" (Line 254); one might therefore expect the performance of EMR to possibly improve (significantly), as the quantity of stored examples of old classes increases.\nBasically, it is difficult to confidently evaluate the superiority of the proposed CRN over prior methods, without taking into consideration the amount of data available to each of these methods. For example, CRN implements memory by storing the top n (prototype) examples (Line 160) for each class - do the other methods such as EMR also have access to n examples?\nIn summary, the relationship between storage capacity (n, apparently maxing out at Upperbound in Figure 2) and performance appears an important factor to explore for the various memory-based models, since the memory-performance tradeoff is central to such models (as otherwise there appears no need to innovate if all old samples can just be stored). While a brief exploration is provided in Figure 3 in the Appendix, it is against a single model on a single dataset, and only up to a relatively limited range of storage (i.e. n=200) 2. For the ablation experiments in Table 2, it might be considered to include various (valid) combinations of exclusions (e.g. w/o PL and w/o FL); in particular, the performance for the baseline memory-based model (i.e. without any of the proposed extensions) would be important in benchmarking against the comparison models.\n3. The effect of the various losses towards their intended function has not been thoroughly covered. For example, it is claimed that \"The performance drops with removing Lco (\"w/o CO\"). It demonstrates that it is helpful to handle medical rare words\" (Line 292). However, this is not substantiated with an analysis of performance on actual items with rare words. These instances might be addressed.\nMinor grammatical/spelling concerns: (Line 97) \"Medica intent\" (Line 124) \"Contrastive Reply Networks\" (reply or replay?) \n(Line 161) \"...top n example(s)\" etc. ",

    "paper_summary": "The paper proposes to trace an agenda for cross-cultural NLP, first by identifying four axes of variation for cultures (linguistic form and style, common ground, aboutness, objectives and values) and describing the challenges related to them; then by highlighting possible strategies for mitigating cultural biases in modern NLP in the areas of data collection, model training and translation.\nI am not an expert on the issues under discussion in this paper, so it is not easy for me to provide a balanced evaluation. I enjoyed reading it, especially for the attempt of brining awareness on cultural issues, which are often neglected in current NLP practices. I think the authors did a very extensive and comprehensive work on the bibliography, which could be useful for correcting biases.\nOn the other hand, I feel that is often difficult to disentangle between linguistic and cultural dimension, and in many cases  the problems/solutions are overlapping with the typical low-resource language scenarios (e.g. where a particular language/dialect/sociolect can be associated with a specific cultural group), and in such cases the general heuristic could be described as \"the more cultural-specific data we can acquire, the better\"; while in other cases it is difficult to propose any conclusive solution (e.g. see the case for model training in Section 6.2, where methods balancing for bias would require access to demographic attributes, but the problem would persist because one cannot really be sure that such attributes adequately reflect culture).  I guess this is a general problematic when one has to deal with something like culture, which is notoriously difficult to define. \nAt the end of my reading, I still feel that I did not get what are, specifically, the directions indicated by the authors (this might well be a limitation of mine) ...

    "paper_summary": "The paper presents an approach to supervised contrastive learning for NLU - classification task by anchoring CL losses using label embeddings. The overall CL loss comprises of three losses. First, the (Multihead) Instance-centered contrastive loss that aims to bring the instance embedding closer to the label embedding by anchoring on the instance and its label as positive example and instance-other labels as negative examples. Second, the label centered contrastive loss which uses labels to mine positive and negative labels from a batch. And finally, to promote better uniformity across learned embeddings - label embeddings are also regularized.  The authors conduct experiments on standard benchmark NLP tasks showing that their approach produces better/competitive results to baselines. They also show the effectiveness of their approach in Few Shot and Data imbalance settings.  Ablation study provides the importance of each of the component / architectural choices. ",
    "strengths": "1. Well written, well reasoned, easy to follow how model / architecture / experiments are setup up. \n2. Extensive experimentation / ablation with statistical significant testing. \n3. Effective use of label semantics in Supervised Contrastive Learning. \n4. The work seems well researched given their knowledge of CL field which is showcased not only in related work section but also the mention of alignment/uniformity, preventing degradation in CL models, regularizing label embeddings etc. From a CL modeling perspective - the authors have crossed all the \"t\"s dotted all the \"i\"s. \n5. Results show improvements / competitiveness across standard benchmarks and their technique is easy to implement / replicate. ",

Research papers should address the why if they wish the community to learn and extend their lessons.\n2. The author mention uniformity / alignment which is win in and off itself but they do not present any results based on these metrics (e.g. in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08821.pdf)  3. Why do the authors use regularization for label embeddings but not for instance embeddings? Given that the goal is improving uniformity - they should have at least considered using (spread out) regularization for instance embeddings too (ref: eq 6 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06320.pdf) ",
    "comments": "1. The claim they make in lines 225-228 are partially true. The equation aids in aligning instance with label embeddings but it does not contain any elements that encourages different instances to disperse. Such dispersion is only encouraged by considering hinge losses or using spread out regularization (e.g. by equation 6 in this paper). As such the claim of uniformity should be removed from lines 225-228.  2. Line 172 should read \"The input of LaCon contains two parts consisting of the text and all the labels for the task) ",

I like how the authors visualize the method in Figure 1. ",
    "weaknesses": "- It is surprising to see that unlike conventional NCE or InfoNCE, the authors omit the positive term in the denominator in equations (3), (4), and (5). In NCE or InfoNCE, adding the positive term in the denominator is intuitive since it is optimizing the log probability of selecting the positive example. However, the authors do not explain the reason behind their counter-intuitive change nor provide an ablation study on this modification. I would like to see the justification of this change and experimental results that support it.\n- In subsection 2.6, the authors introduce LaCon with label fusion which requires additional computation compared to LaCon-vanilla and CE baseline. It would be better if the authors can quantify the computation overhead by providing the inference time of the methods.\n- The Instance-centered Contrastive Loss (ICL) is not very novel given that it is just a different view of the softmax classifier. By treating the weights of the last linear layer as the embedding vectors of each class, optimizing the cross-entropy is almost identical to ICL (except that the vectors should be L2 normalized which is basically applying weight normalization to the last linear layer and normalize the features right before the last layer).

The proposed loss is similar to both NCE and InfoNCE, so changing either the citation or name of the method is fine. The same error also appears in line 94.\n- The proposed method lies in the metric learning field; however, the authors do mention the related metric learning work in their section 5 (related work). For example, the contrastive loss was first proposed by Chopra et al. (2005) and triplet loss (Weinberger et al., 2005; Schroff et al., 2015) is also quite relevant to this paper.\n- It would be great if we can see that the proposed method works for other pretrained models besides BERT as well.\nReferences - Oord, Aäron van den et al. “Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding.” ArXiv abs/1807.03748 (2018): n. pag.\n- Chopra, Sumit, Raia Hadsell, and Yann LeCun. \" Learning a similarity metric discriminatively, with application to face verification.\" 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05).

Therefore, this paper proposes a sentiment word aware MSA model named SWRM, which detects and alleviates the harm caused by sentiment word prediction errors of the ASR models. Specifically, SWRM consists of a sentiment word position detection module based on BERT, a multimodal feature extraction module based on LSTM and BERT, an aggregation network and a multimodal gating network for fusing different features. ",

This paper focuses on the problem that the sentiment word prediction errors of the ASR models corrupt the effects of current state-of-the-art MSA models, which is valuable in practice. \n2. The proposed model SWRM achieved improvements over other baselines, especially when the ASR model performed poorly. ",

The contribution of this paper is slightly less: the improvement on prediction effect of SWRM seems to mainly come from the capability of BERT in detecting the position of sentiment words and predicting correct sentiment words. \n2. Lacking the evaluation of sentiment word detection and correction: since the key ideas of SWRM are the detection and correction of possible sentiment word errors, I think it is necessary to conduct experiments to validate the effects of the sentiment word position detection module and the predicted sentiment word candidates. \n3. Insufficient datasets and explanation of experimental settings: this paper only used one dataset (CMU-MOSI) for evaluation, which cannot fully compare the performance and robustness between SWRM and baseline models. Particularly, CMU-MOSI is one of the datasets employed by Dumpala et al. (2018), and there is a larger dataset named CMU-MOSEI in (Dumpala et al., 2018). It is suggested to add the CMU-MOSEI dataset for evaluation. Moreover, the experimental part doesn’t mention the setting of hyperparameters. \n4. Lines 308-319 are quite confused to me.

As mentioned above, I think that supplementary datasets are important for better comparing SWRM and baselines. Moreover, the effect of sentiment word detection and correction of SWRM should better be shown. \n3. From my opinion, instead of correcting sentiment word errors from the ASR models, improving the performance of the ASR models is a thorough solution to guarantee the effect of the MSA models in practice.

However, the method proposed by Lin et al was used as baseline. Instead, the paper compared to an older baseline proposed by (Garg et al., 2019). Besides, this baseline by Garg et al (+align) seems to contradict the claim in the abstract since it always performs worse than the baseline without word-alignment (Table 2). If for some practical reason, the baseline of (Lin et al., 2020) can’t be used, it needs to be explained clearly.\n2. In Table 2, the proposed approaches only outperform the baselines in 1 setup (out of 3). In addition, there is no consistent trend in the result (i.e. it’s unclear which proposed method (+w2w) or (+FA) is better). Thus, the results presented are insufficient to prove the benefits of the proposed methods. To better justify the claims in this paper, additional experiments or more in-depth analysis seem necessary.\n3.

    "paper_summary": "This paper argues that existing benchmarks for the text-to-SQL task have failed to capture the out-of-domain problem on column operations, matching domain-specific phrases to composite operation over columns. To tackle this problem, the authors propose a synthetic dataset together with a repartitioned train/test SQUALL dataset. On the methodology, prior domain knowledge is injected via column expansion templates, which requires a small amount of manual effort. For example, a \"time_span\" column can be expanded as \"start_time\" and \"end_time\" columns. Schema pruning is also proposed to drop irrelevant columns. In this way, column operations can be reduced to regular column matching. Empirical results on the two datasets show that the proposed method can significantly outperform two strong baseline parsers, seq2seq of Shi et al. (2020) and SmBop of Rubin and Berant (2021). ",
    "strengths": "1. This paper reveals a new perspective of out-of-domain generalization on the text-to-SQL parsing, which I feel is a practical problem and valuable to the community. \n2. A synthetic dataset covering three domains (finance, sports, and science) has been newly created. The existing SQUALL has been repartitioned considering column operations such as field accessors or arithmetic operations. Both datasets target the domain generalization of column operation. \n3. The proposed method may seem to be engineering, where a small amount of manual effort is needed to design templates for schema expansion. But it works well on the two proposed datasets. The improvement against the baseline parsers is significant. And it helps the parser to relieve the burden of reasoning and reduces the column operations to a column matching problem. Schema pruning is also proposed to boost performance. \n4. The experimental study, as well as the discussion, is comprehensive. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. My biggest concern is whether the templates are domain or dataset-specific. The motivation is to address the domain generalization on column operations, but it is implemented by manually crafted ad-hoc templates that could be tailored for the datasets. I understand this paper is the first step to tackle this problem. The authors also say that improvement does exist and automatic schema expansion is worth future study. \n2.

    "paper_summary": "This paper aims at reducing the inference computational cost of transformer-based information retrieval, which is high in traditional encoder-only approaches since the model needs to be run on all document-query combinations. To reduce the computational cost, this work adapts an encoder-decoder model to this task, such that the encoder only needs to be run once per document and the computational cost decreases from `num_documents * num_queries * (encoder_cost + decoder_cost)` to `num_documents * encoder_cost + num_documents * num_queries * decoder_cost`. To improve ranking performance, this work follows Nogueira et al 2020 and generates a special boolean token after generating the query, while training is a combination of classification loss and language modeling loss. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves similar performance to Nogueira et al 2020 while being a few times faster. ",
    "strengths": "1. The proposed paradigm allows caching encoder representations and suits well the typical information retrieval scenarios where running the encoder is more expensive than running the decoder, since the query is usually shorter than the documents in the database. \n2. Empirically this work achieves similar performance (using statistical tests) while being a few times faster than Nogueira et al 2020. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The main claim of this work is faster inference compared to the baselines, at a slight cost of accuracy, However, one can achieve the same goal by using the more accurate (but slower) baselines, but initially retrieving a smaller candidate set (e.g., instead of using 1k candidates, use BM25 to retrieve 500). This might be a baseline worth comparing to to show that it improves the Pareto frontier of the speed/accuracy tradeoff. \n2. Some claims rely on having a difference not statistically significant, but the test sets are small and it's not surprising to not get statistical significance. ( In the extreme if the test set has only a few examples, then BM25 might be the fastest algorithm while \"its effectiveness is not significantly different from baselines\".) I think it's more convincing to draw conclusions based on statistically significant results, such as ED2LM-base being statistically better than T5-small (unfortunately T5-small seems more efficient). As one example, line 468 states that \"For ED2LM-base, its effectiveness is not significantly different from T5-large on both TREC DL Tracks and under-performs by 0.7 (38.7 vs 39.4) on MS MARCO, while providing a 6.2X speed up.\", but the same can be said when comparing to T5-base although at a less impressive speedup. \n3. The change from previous encoder-decoder ranking models such as Zhuang et al 2021b seems incremental: instead of using the likelihood of the query, this work follows Nogueira et al 2020 and uses a special boolean token in the end.

    "paper_summary": "(This is a resubmission that is re-assigned to me, so I'm pasting my previous comments here and append updates at the end for each section.)\nThis paper builds upon the existing round-trip-based definition of NMT adversarial examples (RTT, Zhang et al. 2021) and points out a problem with the approach -- that is, the semantic destruction that happened during round-trip translation might be solely introduced by the back-translation process. To alleviate this problem, the paper proposes an alternative definition -- Doubly Round-trip Translation (DRTT), that adds another round-trip translation process starting from the target-side, to ensure that the semantic destruction is not solely introduced by back-translation.\nSince this definition does not enforce source-side semantic agreement, the authors choose to build bilingual adversarial pairs (such that the target-side sentence will still have the same semantic as the perturbed source). To build such adversarial examples, the paper proposes a generation procedure that involves finding phrase pairs between parallel sentence pairs and conduct paired phrasal replacement with MLM and TLM.\nExperiments show that training NMT models on such adversarial examples as augmentation data (?) can improve the model's robustness on both artificially and naturally noisy test sets compared to several other existing adversarial example generation methods.\n=== UPDATE === The change introduced by the authors are as follows as far as I can tell: 1. moved around the notation explanation closer to where they are used so it's easier for the readers to follow. \n2. added a paragraph right before Section 4 to explain how the generated adversarial data is used. \n3. added an extra dataset created with CharSwap method (Michel et al. 2019) to test under robustness under meaning-preserving perturbations 4. case study moved to the appendix. ",
    "strengths": "+ The re-formulation of existing adversarial example generation is very insightful and will make a good reference for the community. It also made the proposal very well-motivated. \n+ Both the DRTT definition and the phrasal replacement algorithm are very clearly presented. ( However, the experiment section is much less so, see my first and second point for weakness.) \n+ The empirical improvements seem significant for both artificially and naturally noisy test sets. The baseline used for comparison seems strong and valid. ",
    "weaknesses": "+ My biggest concern with this paper is that there is a very significant transition gap between Section 3 and 4. Specifically, Section 3 is talking about a data generation method, while Section 4 starts with \"We evaluate our model under... \". It took a second pass through the earlier sections and some educated guess to conclude that the \"model\" is trained using adversarial data. \n+ Related to the above point, I don't think an adequate amount of experimental details are given for future work to reproduce the results in this paper at all. For example, if I understood correctly and the models are indeed trained on the adversarial data, what are the resulting training data size for the baseline and different augmentation methods? Are the original (non-adversarial) training data still used? Also, for results in Table 2, what is the system that is used to conduct back-translation? Is it the same system across different methods or not? \n+ The phrasal replacement procedure implicitly assume that the TLM to generate correct translation for the phrase so and still makes a valid translation pair. I hope to see some analysis on how strong is that assumption.\n=== UPDATE === The first and the second point has been properly addressed in the author's reply and the revision. As for the third point, the authors offered the case study and the improvement in robustness as a reply, which does prove part of it, but what I have in mind is something more specific like comparing the human evaluation score (as the translation of $x_{\\delta}$) of (1) $y_{\\delta}$; (2) $y_{\\delta}'$; (3) human translation of $x_\\delta$. Ideally, (1) and (3) should be very close while (2) should be much worse. This is obviously too much to ask for resubmission on such a short cycle, though.\nI do concur with the reviewer ag2n's concern that the paper \"is very parsimonious when it comes to citing previous work\".

It would be more relevant and important to remark on how much the degree of ambiguity (number of possible options) varies across dataset examples and whether that was sampled uniformly, by difficulty, or otherwise during data augmentation. It would also be helpful to include whether this degree of ambiguity is reflected in real-world dialog systems as opposed to benchmark WoZ-collected datasets like MultiWOZ and SGD --- essentially, the problem seems to be intuitive, but the paper lacks some context on how widespread the issue actually is. \n2. The results only support the assertions that \"augmentation helps resolve ambiguity\" and \"augmentation brings no harm\" for the specific model used; however, the JGA numbers in Table 3 are a fair degree below state of the art for the original data (~60 for MultiWOZ, ~80-90 for SGD) which raises questions about whether the augmented data and disambiguation task are applicable to state of the art modeling techniques for task oriented dialog. It would have been important to either experiment with additional models or at least include baseline numbers for state of the art models applied to each dataset (and augmented dataset). \n3. The named entity recognition accuracy metric seems to be weak compared to the proposed scale of the problem. If ambiguity is supposed to cause issues in task-oriented dialog models it would be important to measure end-to-end metrics like success rate, inform rate, as well as preference tracking and dialog policy learning (all metrics used in the base MultiWOZ/SGD settings) to demonstrate whether the proposed database result disambiguation task helps in the downstream dialog task and the end goal of the system. There are no data/experiments generalizing this to usage in end-to-end systems. Similarly, the assertion of \"augmentation brings no harm\" is not supported for general end-to-end task oriented dialog. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper focuses on alleviating two challenges of privacy-preserving inference of pre-trained models. The first is how to protect users’ plain text data from access by third-party service providers, and the second one is the performance issue. The method of THE-X converts a fine-tuned model into a cloud service and processes users' data without peaking the data itself. And in inference, the text is anonymous and the results are computed in the ciphertext.  Homomorphic encryption (HE) is used to guarantee the solution and multiple approximation components in the transformer model are designed. Empirical results show that THE-X could conduct privacy-preserving inference with promising results. ",

I strongly suggest that the paper should present the **average** results on the **test set** with clearly defined error bars under different random seeds.  - Another concern is that the method may not be practical. In fine-tuning, THE-X firstly drops the pooler of the pre-trained model and replaces softmax and GeLU, then conducts standard fine-tuning. For the fine-tuned model, they add LayerNorm approximation and d distill knowledge from original LN layers. Next, they drop the original LN and convert the model into fully HE-supported ops. The pipeline is too complicated and the knowledge distillation may not be easy to control.  - Only evaluating the approach on BERTtiny is also not convincing although I understand that there are other existing papers that may do the same thing. For example, a BiLSTM-CRF could yield a 91.03 F1-score and a BERT-base could achieve 92.8. Although computation efficiency and energy-saving are important, it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate the proposed approach. ",

    "paper_summary": "The paper introduces a new Chinese semantic role labeling (SRL) dataset, MuPAD, that covers 6 domains (product comment, web fiction, law, medical etc.). The dataset is motivated by the fact that most Chinese SRL research has been on the news domain. A frame-free annotation scheme was adopted to avoid difficulty in determining frames of novel predicates. A total of 24 semantic role labels, including core and non-core ones, are used in the annotation. In addition to annotation procedure and quality control, the paper provides analysis on the annotations, including consistency on predicates/arguments, accuracy of annotators, and distribution of labels. Finally, the paper shows cross-domain transfer learning experiment results. The authors use a multi-task learning (MLT) approach, adding an auxiliary task of parsing a previous dataset with a different scheme but sharing the embeddings and some model parameters. On average across the domains, this approach outperforms the baseline by a large margin. They also showed that using contextualized word representation from BERT can further boost the performance, but the gap between MLT and baseline become smaller. ",
    "strengths": "1. The dataset is in a reasonably large scale. It is constructed under solid methodology and the process is documented in detail. Moreover, performance drop in domain shift is a prominent issue for learning-based approaches to NLP, so this multi-domain dataset has great potential to drive future research towards this important direction. \n2. The authors conducted systematic experiments on cross-domain transfer learning. The results illustrate the performance drop in domain shift and demonstrate how much we can get by applying several standard techniques (MTL, contextualized embeddings). These are informative for understanding the status of the task (Chinese SRL) so are worth sharing with the research community. \n3. In addition to methodology and experiments, the paper is also comprehensive in reviewing related datasets and approaches. The whole paper is organized well and is easy to read. It also does a good job explaining some Chinese-specific linguistic phenomena which may have brought challenges to the annotators. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The paper covers little qualitative aspects of the domains, so it is hard to understand how they differ in linguistic properties. For example, I think it is vague to say that the fantasy novel is more “canonical” (line 355). Text from a novel may be similar to that from news articles in that sentences tend to be complete and contain fewer omissions, in contrast to product comments which are casually written and may have looser syntactic structures. However, novel text is also very different from news text in that it contains unusual predicates and even imaginary entities as arguments. It seems that the authors are arguing that syntactic factors are more significant in SRL performance, and the experimental results are also consistent with this. Then it would be helpful to show a few examples from each domain to illustrate how they differ structurally. \n2. The proposed dataset uses a new annotation scheme that is different from that of previous datasets, which introduces difficulties of comparison with previous results. While I think the frame-free scheme is justified in this paper, the compatibility with other benchmarks is an important issue that needs to be discussed. It may be possible to, for example, convert frame-based annotations to frame-free ones. I believe this is doable because FrameNet also has the core/non-core sets of argument for each frame. It would also be better if the authors can elaborate more on the relationship between this new scheme and previous ones. Besides eliminating the frame annotation, what are the major changes to the semantic role labels? ",

(2019a) earlier, to make it clear and precise.\n- More information about the annotators would be needed. Are they all native Chinese speakers? Do they have linguistics background?\n- Were pred-wise/arg-wise consistencies used in the construction of existing datasets? I think they are not newly invented. It is useful to know where they come from.\n- In the SRL formulation (Sec. 5), I am not quite sure what is “the concerned word”. Is it the predicate? Does this formulation cover the task of identifying the predicate(s), or are the predicates given by syntactic parsing results?\n- From Figure 3 it is not clear to me how ZX is the most similar domain to Source. Grouping the bars by domain instead of role might be better (because we can compare the shapes). It may also be helpful to leverage some quantitative measure (e.g. cross entropy).\n- How was the train/dev/test split determined? This should be noted (even if it is simply done randomly). ",

    "paper_summary": "### Overview of the paper The paper presents **MuPAD**, a Chinese dataset for evaluating systems on Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), with a particular focus on out-of-domain performance. The authors argue that, over the recent years, research in SRL has predominantly focused on in-domain settings where a model is trained and evaluated on data coming from the same distribution/domain (CoNLL-2005 and CoNLL-2009 are two exceptions as they provide an out-of-domain test set, but it is extremely small only 400 sentences).\nIn order to address this issue, the authors collected sentences from various domains, more precisely, 1 source domain on which systems are usually trained and 5 target domains (out-of-distribution with respect to source domain). Then, they annotated the collected sentences with semantic role labels using a frame-free methodology (which eliminates the need to instruct the annotators about an ontology, e.g., PropBank or FrameNet), trained a system on the source domain and evaluated the resulting system on the out-of-domain test sets.\nThe main takeaway is that, indeed, even though the system achieves very good results on the test set of the source domain, there is a significant drop in performance on the target domains. These results motivate the need for MuPAD as a benchmark to evaluate current and future SRL systems on out-of-domain test sets too.\n### Overall considerations In general, the paper is quite good but there are also some important drawbacks. As a researcher in SRL, I am usually very excited to see new resources for the task but, in this case, it seems like MuPAD will not be released openly to the research community. Without an open resource, the paper is still good (findings?) as it discusses the limitations of current SRL systems on out-of-domain instances. ",
    "strengths": "### Main strengths - **Resource:** A large dataset with manual predicate-argument annotations. The dataset comprises over 30K sentences in **Chinese** that were annotated by at least two annotators (and checked by a third annotator in case of disagreement).\n- **Annotation methodology:** The authors spend a significant part of the paper describing their annotation methodology, its motivation, and the results. The methodology consisted in assigning each annotation item (sentence + predicate) to two (paid) undergraduate students who were trained beforehand. In case of disagreement, an expert annotator was involved to solve the disagreement. The results of the annotation process are described showing \"consistency ratio\" between the two annotators (which motivates the employment of an expert annotator to solve the disagreements).\n### Minor strengths - **Empirical results:** The authors show how an SRL system performs on the task (in-domain and out-of-domain results). They use a system based on that of Cai et al. (2018) which is a bit old now (surpassed by many other systems in other benchmarks), but it is still good baseline. Moreover, the authors report the results of their system when trained jointly on MuPAD and the Chinese PropBank 2.0. In this setting, the results of the system are better but there is still a very noticeable drop in performance between source and target domains.\n- **Hidden arguments:** The authors made the annotators indicate hidden arguments in the sentences, i.e., arguments that are implicit in the sentence. ",
    "weaknesses": "### Major weaknesses - **Dataset availability:** My major concern is about the availability of this dataset. Nowhere in the paper is stated that MuPAD will be openly released, which suggests that it will be released behind a paywall. In my opinion, this is the most disheartening weakness of this work in general (beyond the paper itself). The reviewers, meta-reviewers, action editors, and everybody else involved in the organization of a conference (e.g., NAACL) are being working on this paper for free, but the dataset will be a paid product. Of course, the creation of a dataset has its costs, but so does every other paper, and there are many datasets that are being released for free nowadays. A paywall is also a roadblock for research in the field. Of course, disregard this point if the dataset will be freely released.\n- **Licensing:** Part of the dataset comes from the Chinese split of CoNLL-2009 which is released with a very restricting license (CoNLL-2009 is available for purchase through the Linguistic Data Consortium and it cannot be redistributed). I imagine that MuPAD will be released with a similar license. ",

As Table 3 shows, BERT-based representations outperform on the task when compared with representations learned by the proposed solution under various settings. Even on the classification task, the performance of BERT and Word2Vec methods is reasonably well. Thus, it is not clear what, if any, are the advantages of using the proposed solution for learning job title representations. Some gains in performance, in some settings, could certainly be achieved but at the cost of significantly more computationally expensive solution compared to using off-the-shelf BERT or W2V representations.

    "paper_summary": "This paper investigates social biases in sense embedding. \nFirst, by either manually (WEAT) or automatically (WAT) assigning sense ids, this paper extends the previous datasets for examining word embedding biases to sense embedding.   Second, this paper proposes a new dataset for testing sense embedding biases (SSSB), by creating templates and filling them with target/attribute words. \nThird, using these datasets, this paper performs a set of experiments to test the social biases of sense embeddings. The results show that different senses of the same word bear different levels of biases. Moreover, even when the word embedding shows low biases, the biases of sense embeddings can be large. \nGenerally, this paper introduces an important but not well-studied research question (i.e. to what extent are sense embeddings biased?), and proposes a framework for testing this (extends existing datasets and creates a new one). However, some choices of the experimental setup can be improved and some of the claims made are not convincing from the existing results. ",
    "strengths": "1. This paper introduces an important yet under-studied research question --- to measure the social biases in sense embeddings. This is very important, because understanding the senses of words is a fundamental problem in NLU, and sense embedding plays a vital role in this direction. \n2. This paper extends the existing datasets (WEAT and WAT) for testing social biases of (static and contextualized) word embedding to sense embeddings, by assigning sense ids to words, either manually (WEAT) or automatically (WAT). The assigning procedure is solid and can thus benefit the following studies.   3. This paper creates a new dataset (SSSB) to examine the biases of sense embeddings. It is very beneficial (as in 2), and most cases of the dataset are of good quality. \n4. Using these datasets, this paper examines the biases of sense embeddings and compares them with word embedding biases. This paper finds that likewise word embeddings, sense embeddings contain social biases as well. Moreover, this paper observes that different senses of the same word are of different bias levels, and they are also different with word embedding biases. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. Some claims in the paper lack enough groundings. For instance, in lines 246-249, \"This difference in the composition of bias types explains why the bias score of BERT is higher in CrowS-Pairs, while the same is higher for SenseBERT in StereoSet.\" This claim will be justified if the authors can provide the specific bias scores and numbers of examples of each bias type, but I didn't find the corresponding part for analyzing this. Also, this paper mentions several times the intuition \"occupations and not actions associated with those occupations are related to gender, hence can encode social biases\" (lines 595-597). However, I don't really agree. Take \"engineer\" as an instance, in the Merriam-webster dictionary, the first meaning of \"engineer\" as a verb (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/engineer#:~:text=engineered%3B%20engineering%3B%20engineers,craft%20engineer%20a%20business%20deal) is \"to lay out, construct, or manage as an engineer\". I think it is very much biased towards the male gender as well, according to social conventions. \n2. Some analyses can be more detailed. For example, in \"language/nationality\", the data includes Japanese, Chinese, English, Arabic,  German... (~20 different types). Biases towards different languages/nationalities are different. I was wondering whether there would be some interesting observations comparing them. \n3. The definition of \"bias\" is debatable. In SSSB, a language that is \"difficult to learn/understand/write\" is considered to be stereotypical, and \"easy to learn/understand/write\" is anti-stereotypical. In daily conversations, I think it is not widely considered as \"biased\". Also, I don't really understand the meaning of \"<xxx language is hash>\". Do you mean \"harsh\" by \"hash\"? If so, I think the conclusions derived from this dataset are less trustworthy. \n4. Writing can be improved. For example, even though I read very carefully, I am not sure I fully follow the method in lines 203-210. It will be nice if you can provide some examples for s(_i) and a(_j) 5. A question: why would you use Equation 7 to derive word embeddings? From your results, I assume the sense embeddings are not normalized. This will bring an issue: the embedding will be dominated by the sense with a larger length. To make the experiments more rigorous, I think it would be nice to also use pre-trained static word embeddings (e.g. skip-gram) and normalize the embedding. ",
    "comments": "1. I think it would be more clear if you can introduce sense embeddings a bit before introducing the bias measuring procedures. \n2. A number of typos exist. Mostly, it doesn't influence the reading. However, sometimes it affects my understanding of the paper (e.g., again \"occupations and not actions associated with those occupations are related to gender\" (lines 595-596, and -> but, if I understand it correctly)). Another round of proofreading may be needed. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper tackles the problem of measuring social biases in sense embeddings. It presents the new Sense-Sensitive Social Bias (SSSB) dataset and extends existing bias evaluation datasets (WEAT and WAT) to be compatible with word sense-level evaluation. It presents new evaluation approaches for measuring social biases in static and contextualized sense embeddings, and reports on experimental analysis of state-of-the-art sense embedding models under these evaluation schemes. The findings demonstrate that sense embeddings do not conform to the behavior of word embeddings with respect to social biases, and that sense embeddings often show higher degrees of bias under the presented evaluations. ",
    "strengths": "This is a strong paper. The text is well written and clearly structured, with a logical flow that makes it easy to follow the arguments. Related work is presented in appropriate detail and the paper is clearly situated with respect to existing work in computational analysis of social biases within the ACL community. The experiments are thorough and well-motivated, and the methodology is clear and reproducible. he analysis is well described and appropriate, and includes a thoughtful discussion of differences in observed behavior between word and sense embeddings on the various datasets evaluated. The three categories included in SSSB are well-motivated, and the occupation/action distinction is an especially clever choice. The tables and figures are (largely) appropriate and informative. ",
    "weaknesses": "The main weakness of this paper is that it is not sufficiently grounded in the sociolinguistic side of bias measurement, and therefore makes some significant claims and design decisions that are not entirely appropriate.\nThe proposed task and the experimental design are predicated on the assumption that word senses as semantically disjoint with respect to social biases, but this is not really true (which is actually nodded to in the paper's discussion section). References to nationality and language can often be used metonymically to imply one another (particularly for voicing negative opinions), and colour and race are most certainly strongly correlated in visual design and storytelling (eg the use of dark colours, especially black, for evil in Western European storytelling, which is less common in African stories). Occupations and associated actions, while not used metonymically, may still be correlated: it is likely higher surprisal to refer to a woman \"engineering a solution\" than a man, for example. ( It is worth noting that the maximum pairwise similarity approach used in WAT calculation runs counter to this assumption of disjoint senses.)\nThere is also an important distinction between observability of a bias (e.g., through surveying/prompting native speakers) and measuring it using computational tools. Social biases may be observable without being measured by current approaches. These nuances are important to discuss throughout the paper: social bias assessment is not a computational task alone, but must incorporate human judgment and be framed through specific human viewpoints with acknowledged limitations.\nThere are several further issues with the precision of the language used in the paper that are important to address when discussing a sensitive topic such as social bias measurement.\n- The term \"bias\" itself needs some context. Biases may be positive or neutral (eg preferring to complete \"they sat at the computer to write ___\" with \"code\" vs \"a book\" when trained on different data), as well as negative. As such, it is not clear what it means to have an \"unbiased\" model, or when that is desirable. A clearer definition of what kinds of bias are being assessed, what their impact is, and what mitigation of these biases might look like will help set the context better.\n- The term \"stereotype\" is not used correctly. A stereotype is a commonly-held association between one group and some attribute or behavior; although most stereotypes involve negative attributes or disfavored behaviors, a stereotype is not inherently negative. The labels of \"stereotype/anti-stereotype\" are therefore not appropriate; positive/negative would be better. ( An anti-stereotype would be something that contradicts the stereotypical attribute or behavior.) Stereotypes are also socially-derived based on common beliefs/associations; for example, \"Japanese people are stupid\" is not a commonly-held belief, so this is not a stereotype.\n- The terms \"pleasant\" and \"unpleasant\" are used, but are not clearly defined and feel subjective enough to mask the import of the difference being discussed. \" Positive\" and \"negative\" are the standard words used to discuss emotional valence of this type; these should either be used or the use of alternatives should be justified and clearly defined.\n- Race and ethnicity are distinct constructs; the evaluation described in Section 4.2 is comparing race senses with colour senses, not ethnicity. ( Ethnicity is related more to heritage and origin, while race is a social group that one can be assigned to by others or identify with voluntarily.)\n- Referring to nationality groups as \"disadvantaged groups\" (Line 286) doesn't quite work; while the racial identities that nationalities are correlated with may be disadvantaged, non-US nationalities themselves are not disadvantaged. ( Eg Scandinavian nationalities are very unlikely to be considered disadvantaged.)\nIt is not clear what the impact could be of measuring bias in sense embeddings or of debiasing sense embeddings. These models are much more rarely used than word embeddings, and in much more specialized settings.\nOther issues with the presentation: - Section 3 is difficult to follow. It is not clear how (X and Y) and (A and B) are related, or what a high or low score on the s and w functions means.\n- Figures 2 and 3 are unreadable.\n- P-value calculation is discussed in Section 3, but no p-values are reported in the experimental results. ",
    "comments": "- The inclusion of the verb sense of \"carpenter\" in Section 4.3 is a little questionable; this is a very rarely-used sense. The other occupation/action words are commonly used and could reasonably be measured, but very few texts (for embedding training) will use carpenter as a verb, and many native speakers will not recognize it as correct.\n- There is growing consensus to capitalize racial identifiers (certainly \"Black\", increasingly \"White\").\n- Lines 442-445: This actually does not accurately simulate the word-level embedding case, as it assigns equal weight to all senses. In practice, word senses are more likely to be Zipf-distributed, so a word-level embedding model will be exposed to much more training data for some senses than for others.\n- It is not clear how the categories in WEAT (Table 2) are associated with the social biases this paper is framed around.\n- It would be helpful to mark the extended WEAT/WAT contributed by this paper using a modified label (eg WEAT*), in Table 2 and in text.\n- The Ethical Statement is well written, but should be extended with some more concrete discussion of challenges not addressed in the dataset (eg gender beyond the binary, races other than Black, other sources of social bias).\n- It would be helpful to have a listing of nationalities/racial identities/occupations included in the dataset (along with the adjectives used) as part of the paper, such as in supplementary tables.\n- It would be interesting to see what human behavior is for these prompts/comparisons... - Dev et al 2019 and Nadeem et al 2020 references are missing publication information.\nTypos - Figure 1, graph titles \"embembeddings\" - Line 051: extra \"is\" - Line 122: missing \"are\" - Line 603: \"bises\" -> \"biases\" - Line 610: missing \"being\" - Spaces not needed between section symbol and number - Spaces after non-terminal periods (\"vs.\", \"cf.\") should be escaped to avoid spacing issues ",

This article reports on a much more extensive experiment: the authors evalute a relatively large number of models (all transformer-based). This make it possible to draw helpful comparative conclusions: for example, model size does not predict performance, and all models fail on some zero-shot tasks, including the ones included in oLMpics which to this human seem quite simple. It also shows that some pessimistic conclusions based on a single model (e.g. Ettinger's negation dataset) are not quite as severe for other models. Overall, it is hard to discern a clear predictor of success (model size, training data size, etc, do not have a consistent effect). ",

It would be helpful to be clearer about this distinction and clarify which analyses in the paper follow which approach.\nOne suggestion to the authors is to change the title to something that is less focused on BERT, captures some of the more noteworthy empirical findings, and avoid \"muppet\" as a generic term for transformer-based language models.\nl. 331: \"same approach\" - which one?

    "weaknesses": "Although this paper proposed many ideal recommendations for researchers and conference organizers to mitigate the Square One Biase issue, I might doubt the value in practice. As discussed in Section 6, doing multi-dimensional research would not only increase the workload of paper authors but also requires conference reviewers to be experts in multiple areas. As a result, the development of the field may be slowed down by the cumbersome evaluation. And besides, if we develop some standard multi-dimensional evaluation protocol, it may also introduce a new Square One Bias (e.g. some particular evaluation methods of fairness and efficiency can become dominant).  But overall, I agree that research that departs from prototypes in multiple dimensions should be encouraged by the reviewers and conference organizers. ",

Systems are then challenged to prefer captions that correctly identify the image. The competencies tested include existence, plurality/counting, spatial reasoning (via prepositions), situational knowledge (via imSitu data), and coreference. The paper evaluates several recent pre-training based models, finding that many fail at their challenges, and that the multi-task model 12-in-1, works best. ",

    "weaknesses": "(being a previous reviewer R BWRg, I will respond to previously identified weakness) I still find the argument of what is and is not included in the diagnostic unclear. In many ways, this seems like a case of a subset of competencies that we have enough visual annotations to semi-automatically create data for. In my opinion, the paper should steer away from making arguments that these examples are deeply linguistic, beyond, involving nouns, counting, verbs, and coreference. As such, I find the title and some of the introduction over-claiming, but, this is really a matter of opinion, resting on what exactly 'linguistic' means.\nThe main body of the paper still lacks examples but I appreciate their inclusion in the appendix. It's very hard to imagine the foils from the descriptions alone. This may be asking a lot, but the paper would be significantly improved if the last page were almost entirely made of examples from the appendix. This is a CVPR style of presentation, and would require significant text trimming.  The examples were good overall, but the co-ref part of the benchmark stands out. It is essentially a QA task, which isn't really compatible with just caption based training that most of the evaluated most are setup to do (with the exception of 12-1). This isn't an issue, because its not really the benchmark's problem, but I am not sure the format of the foil is that sensible. I suspect this will be the least used of the new foils, but I don't have a concrete proposal how it could be improved to really be a captioning task. ",

It’s described as a “competitive baseline”; that feels a bit like underselling it, as there’s already an existing baseline (FGWS) in addition to the common-sense PPL, and the proposed method is well motivated, well investigated (e.g. in the analysis of error bounds in App A.2) and performs well with respect to these existing baselines.\n- There are a lot of detailed method definitions and experimental results provided in the main paper and in the supplementary material, including ablation studies etc, helpfully pre-empting a lot of potential questions.

I’d suggest the authorsnote up front in Sec 1 the FGWS method used as a comparator as an existing detection method: the current intro conveys the idea that existing methods are more limited than they are, and this is only rectified in Sec 5.  In particular, I’d characterise the differences with respect to FGWS – at a high level they have the similar idea of detecting low frequency samples (Fig 1 caption of present paper), but the approach is quite different.

    "paper_summary": "The authors released a dataset of adversarial examples generated with four NLP models for three text classification datasets under four attack algorithms. The dataset was created to evaluate how well a model can discriminate adversarial examples from clean ones. A baseline for detecting adversarial examples also has been proposed in which the authors assume that the distributions of the clean example’s features follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and apply kPCA to reduce the feature dimensionality and MCD to remove the outliers in the training set. However, it is not very useful to statically detect the adversarial examples generated by a particular attack algorithm because, in the real situation, an adversary attempts to find the weakness of a victim model by continually querying the victim through a trial-and-error strategy, and such dynamically generated adversarial examples are hard to be detected especially when the attack algorithm used by the adversary is unknown in advance. To me, it seems very hard to model natural texts via a multivariate Gaussian distribution due to the discrete nature of texts since the number of examples in a dataset is not sufficient for such modeling.

This semantic dissociation from syntax is learned in representation obtained from the pre-trained models (mBERT and XLM-100). This decoupling model reduces the ‘violation of syntactic constraint’ and advances the answer-span boundary detection performance (for Question Answering (QA) tasks) in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer for low-resource languages. The proposed approach uses two-step training (with labeled parallel and task-specific datasets) and six linguistically inspired training losses in two combinations (models).  The Experiments are conducted on one task (QA), three datasets (MLQA, XQuAD, TyDiQA), and across nine languages. Extensive experiments and an ablation study are conducted to support the paper's claim. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper addresses some key issues of the Entity Set Expansion (ESE) problem; from the evaluation metrics and dataset perspective. The authors mentioned that existing datasets do not consider entities that belong to multiple concepts, are non-named and vaguely attached to the concepts they belong to. They show how their benchmark datasets capture these properties. They also argue that MAE at top-20, which is a standard evaluation metric for ESE approaches, is not sufficient to understand their effectiveness. They propose MAE. at gold-k as an alternative. ",
    "strengths": "The paper proposes three benchmark datasets that are helpful for evaluating ESE approaches. The authors focus on three key issues of ESE datasets and address those in constructing their own datasets. ",
    "weaknesses": "The study is not well motivated. The paper does not consider the application perspective of ESE approaches and the arguments about evaluation metrics is not strong. The description of the dataset construction process is inadequate. ",
    "comments": "What is the motivation behind applying ESE methods on user-generated text? Why would someone apply set expansion approaches to construct a dictionary from customer reviews? For example, a customer might mention that the room type of a hotel is small. How does that help in constructing a dictionary for the room type concept?   “We first select concepts for the seed by referring to the features on the corresponding websites, to ensure their relevance for immediate downstream tasks.” - This is how the authors define the relevance for immediate downstream tasks. But, I worry if ESE has application in such scenarios. In fact, ESE is a useful mechanism when a concept is complicated enough to be expressed as a query. The concepts selected by the authors in this paper are well-defined by the site owners.  The argument about the new metric MAP at gold-k is not solid. From the retrieval perspective MAP at top-20 still makes sense. If someone is interested to retrieve all the entities belonging to a concept, they can look at the top-20 retrieved entities, annotate them, and then get more seeds to train a model to retrieve more. Based on this iterative process, one can find all the relevant entities belonging to a concept. There is a Total Recall track at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) that tries to achieve this. That’s why we should not disregard MAP at top-20, but we can explore the performance of a method at gold-k for reference. How does the map at gold-k makes sense from the application perspective? If an ESE approach returns a ranked list of entities, at which depth a user should go to find all the relevant entities? The user does not have any idea about gold-k and could only go to some pre-defined depth such as 20. Different depths could be explored considering how much effort a user is interested to put in, but MAP at top-20 should never be ignored.  “Existing evaluation metrics tend to overestimate the real-world performance of ESE methods and may be unreliable for evaluating concepts with large entity sets.” — I do not agree with this takeaway because of the above statement.  The effectiveness of ensemble approaches is not surprising.  The performance difference between CGExpan and LM-Base (proposed by the authors) is striking even if the underlying techniques are very similar. Can the authors provide more insight into this? Why does LM-base perform so well compared to CGExpan in user-generated datasets? I wonder if there could be hyperparameters for CGExpan that are not well-tuned.  I find the dataset description to be inadequate. Specifically, the source of the data is not clearly mentioned. ",

Higher confidence indicates less hints provided. The two models are trained jointly, where NMT learns the task and the confidence network learns to produce the correct confidence.

    "paper_summary": "The paper discusses a multi-task learning (MTL) approach for scoring an essay text, both holistically, as well as in terms of different traits, such as content, organization, style, prompt adherence, etc. In this work, the authors treat scoring the essay traits as auxiliary tasks and scoring the essay holistically as the primary task. The architecture of the STL stack is based on the work by Dong et al. (2017). The output of individual essay traits (scores) are concatenated with the essay representation for the primary task and passed through a dense layer to predict the overall score for the essay. For the experiments, the authors use the ASAP AEG dataset, consisting of 8 essay sets, and quadratic weighted Kappa (QWK) as the evaluation metric. Along with the MTL system, where the holistic scoring is the primary task, the work evaluates alternative configurations (MTL*), where one of the essay traits is treated as the primary task and the other traits, along with the holistic scoring, are treated as auxiliary tasks. The paper also explores the speedup in overall training time and the associated cost in terms of loss in scoring the essay traits. By performing an ablation study to analyze the most important trait, this work also observes that content is the most significant trait for three of the essay sets, while prompt adherence and word choice are the most significant for the two essay sets, where they are scored.\nOverall, this is a well-written paper that explores whether training signals from the essay trait scoring tasks can be used to score a model holistically. This work can be a good example of the application of MTL in settings, where the primary task is intuitively influenced by the auxiliary tasks, but the weightage of the individual tasks in this aggregation is not definitive or well-established.\n-- The above review is based on my understanding of the previous and current submissions. Strengths, weaknesses, and scores are based on the author responses and current revised draft. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper presentes a multi task learning approach for automatic grading of English essays, by considering a holistic score as well as scores on individual essay traits. The authors proposed an LSTM based model and compared single task and multi task settings to show that Multi-task learning based system gives better performance, and is also much faster than the single task setup. They also present a comparison with a BERT model, and report a series of ablation tests to understand the relationship between traits and holistic scores. ",
    "strengths": "In Automatic Essay Scoring research, it is more common to develop models for a holistic scoring, although in general, there is an agreement that a score may have many dimensions (e.g., content, spelling/grammar, organization etc). This paper is among the few papers in the direction of modeling multiple dimensions of essay scoring.\nThey performed ablation tests in the multi task learning setup, to understand what traits are useful for each set of essays - I think this is an interesting experiment I did not see before in this task's context.\nThey use a popular dataset which is publicly available and uploaded their code along with the paper.

Simple baselines (e.g., document length) that are commonly used for this problem can be used as a comparison point, in a STL setup, where the predicted variable can be different (holistic score, individual trait scores), keeping the text representation constant.\n- The paper misses a discussion on the limitations of the current approach. For example, the authors commented in the response pdf to one of the reviewers that performance difference across traits is due to topical variation. The modeling process does not have any specific component to account for such topical variations resulting in different scores. It could be a potential limitation. I am not saying a paper is bad because it has a limitation. I think acknowledging limitations gives a more holistic perspective for the reader about the approach. ",

One other comment:  - How are the trait  scores obtained for the prompts that did not have them in the original dataset? The authors claim they took from another source, but understanding how they are created is relevant for this paper.  - I think having a few points of comparison to your approach will give a better perspective for us as readers. Comparison between LSTM and BERT is good, but not enough, as  this topic still has a dominant approach of combining some linguistic features with neural models, for modeling overall score. For individual traits too, predicting the trait score instead of individual score, keeping rest of the set up same, may give you a quick comparison point, and make the paper more complete. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper introduced an extended definition which extends unimodal DST to multimodal DST. To demonstrate this new schema of DST, the authors generated dialogues based on an extended CATER video split, with additional ground-truth labeling for bounding boxes and visual objects across frames.  The dialogues mainly focus on visually-grounded object reasoning, where a question is raised to query the states of objects in the given video clip.\nThe proposed DST definition comprises of dialogue states from the traditional DST setting and dialogue states that represent the states of visible objects. Two temporal-based slots are also added such that an object can be located by each turn.\nThe model architecture is based on an autoregressive approach, where the dialogue states of last turn along with turn utterances (t-1 and t) are given to generate the frame start/end and object states. The backbone is Transformer block, and Mask Vision Modeling (similar to Mask Language Modeling) is used to self-supervise the learning of visual representations.\nIn experiments, the authors presented several baseline models to evaluate different aspects of the proposed DVD-DST dataset. The model outperformed these baselines, and analyses on model components were provided. ",
    "strengths": "1. The paper is generally well-written. Most of the content does not cause confusion. \n2. The introduction of Multimodal DST (MM-DST) is interesting. Though there are some concurrent works in introducing MM-DST, the paper defines a more complete set of dialogue states: single object to multiple, and maintaining object states also becomes a DST task. This new definition is in general convincing and promising, and can be extended to more complex MM-DST problems. \n3. The creation of the dataset refers to prior work and took into consideration the distribution bias of datasets. Potential biasedness was further discussed with some simple baseline models proposed in Sec. 4. It can be seen that the dataset is generally in high quality. \n4. The video self-supervised training improved the overall performance, showing that with this technique, the Transformer blocks learn to distinguish visual cues and learn meaningful representations. \n5. The experiments and ablation studies are rich and cover most of potential research questions. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. The extension to the unimodal DST definition is good enough in the CATER dataset, but why the authors pick the CATER dataset as the basis is not obvious and lacks further discussion. This dataset contains only simple objects and questions related to their positioning and movements.  This is very “synthetic” and so that the proposed MM-DST definition is very limited to simple objects and movements. How can this definition be extended to broader and more real applications, like other real-world dialogue systems and QA machines? \n2. The clarification of different models being compared is not clear enough. Many baseline models are proposed and compared, but for most of them this paper did not explain why they were proposed, what are expected, and further discussions are still missing. The current form is a bit messy in Line 409-436, 461-509. \n3. The comparison with baseline systems is not very convincing. The baseline systems such as TRADE are already old. They have low performance in unimodal DST, to the best of my knowledge. For example, TRADE is a very basic model (48.62%), and NA-DST achieved only 50.52% on MultiWOZ 2.0. However, the current best model from the leaderboard of MultiWOZ ([budzianowski/multiwoz: Source code for end-to-end dialogue model from the MultiWOZ paper (Budzianowski et al. 2018, EMNLP) (github.com)](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz)) is: [KAGE-GPT2](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.620.pdf) (Lin et al, 2021) with 54.86% on MultiWOZ 2.0 and [TripPy + SaCLog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00291) (Dai et al. 2021) with 60.61 on MultiWOZ 2.1. Based on the approach the authors are using, [SimpleTOD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00796.pdf) (Hosseini-Asl et al. 2020) suits better since it generates dialogue states in an auto-regressive way as well. Furthermore, it is also unfair to compare with unimodal DST systems that were not trained on image understanding. Thus, it is more fair to train those baseline systems (at least one of them) with self-supervised learning. \n4. The join training of L_seg and L_obj seems to underperform either alone. This was neither tackled nor deeply discussed. This component should be crucial to the overall performance, and thus better analysis is required. ",
    "comments": "1. Though the paper presented a fair amount of good work, the current presentation should be improved. For example, the captions of tables and figures should contain necessary explanations of what are presented and what are the major findings that a reader should put focus on.

Reference should be put to ambiguous descriptions (e.g. refer Line 253,254 to Fig.2 such that examples of OBJ<class> can be well understood). Line 261: R^{L_obj x 4}: 4 should be x1 x2 y1 y2, and this should be stated. Table 3:  the meaning of (tracking) should be clearly stated, or use another name like “w/ oracle bounding box labels”. Line 506-509, use the formal names instead of only citations for these models. Line 543-546: not understandable. Line 193, redundant first “|”, {}|_{some conditions} is enough. \n2. In general, this paper presented a fairly good amount of work. And the shift from unimodal to multimodal is on the right track. Though there is still a lot to improve, I believe that the authors are moving towards an impactful work. \n3. Well, DVD-DST - what does DVD mean.....

Different from these methods, the proposed framework adopts an in-stance weighting method for punishing false negatives and a gradient-based algorithm for generating noise-based negatives towards the most nonuniform points.

In fact, those are “hard negatives” which has been shown in many contrastive works as essential in learning a high-quality representation. \nThe authors can also do a better job at explaining why starting with a Gaussian negatives and optimizing equation (3) and (4) can lead to negatives sampled from non-uniform semantic space.

    "paper_summary": "This paper addresses a text classification task: assigning ICD-9-CM codes to a clinical text.  This is a difficult task because only short spans of the input text are relevant to a given target code, hence the use of attention mechanisms in recent work.  In the present work, multiple synonyms are used in the attention mechanism in order to attend to all descriptions of a code.  Furthermore, a biaffine transformation is learnt to help compare synonym representations to the representation of the input text for a given code. \nThat combination of using multiple synonyms in the attention mechanism and a biaffine transformation in the architecture is novel to the best of my knowledge.  On the MIMIC-III ICD9 coding dataset (full and top-50 codes), both sub-methods are shown to improve results over using a single term per code or learning independent code representations as in previous work. \nThe paper finally explores the space of synonym representations. ",
    "strengths": "- The introduction of multiple synonyms and of the biaffine transformation in the architecture is motivated.\n- Each are shown to bring improvements.\n- Improves over previous state of the art, represented by five published systems.\n- Short exploration of the resulting synonym representation space.

    "comments": "- The basic principle of using multiple synonyms of ICD terms is quite common in earlier work: using the presence of ICD in the UMLS makes it straightforward to obtain more terms for the same ICD code, and terms can then be used to help concept extraction and normalization from text.  In a way, it is therefore surprising that recent work using deep learning methods does not use this simple resource. \n  - Note that in the related task of entity linking, for instance BioSyn (Sung et al., ACL 2020) uses multiple synonyms for each concept.\n- How did you sample the synonyms when not all of them are selected: fully randomly? \n  - what if less synonyms are available than the required number $m$?  Does this happen in the performed experiments?\n- More synonyms probably increase the memory and time requirements: can you say more about the complexity of the method relative to the number of synonyms?\n- \"Deep learning methods usually treat this task as a multi-label classification problem\": this is the case more generally of supervised machine learning methods, and is not specific to deep learning methods.\n- \"A d-layer bi-directional LSTM layer with output size h /is followed by/ word embeddings to obtain text hidden representations H.\" -> I assume that the LSTM takes word embeddings as input instead?\n- \"We notice that the macro F1 has large variance in MIMIC-III full setting\": please explain what you mean by variance here.

    "paper_summary": "The paper presents a transformer based model for generating paraphrases for an input sentence with an added constraint of following a specific syntactic template. The proposed architecture consists of a normal transformer encoder to encode the source sentence, a tree-based transformer encoder to encode the syntax of the template, and finally a decoder which utilizes both sentence and syntax embeddings to generate the paraphrase. An additional attention regularization term is added to the cross entropy loss to explicitly align the decoder-syntax encoder cross-attention map to the paraphrase-template alignment known at training time. A template retriever is also proposed which can retrieve the appropriate templates for the input sentence, as for a given sentence not all syntactic templates would be compatible. Through the experiments, authors show that their method can outperform the existing baselines by a good margin, in terms of semantic and semantic similarity with the reference, as well as on the ability to generate diverse paraphrases. ",

The metrics reported in this paper for SGCP are significantly worse than even the copy baselines which makes me a bit doubtful about validity of the results reproduced by the authors.\nOverall, through the revision the authors seem to have partially addressed my major issues with the first version but a significant portion is still unaddressed as pointed out above. I request the authors to try to rectify these in their final submission, especially the second point on the performance metrics for the SGCP baseline. ",

Further, as a part of the experiment, the authors also put quality checks in place to ensure that they were getting good quality data. To avoid traditional quality checks, the authors introduced a random degraded model and monitored how crowdsourced workers rated those models compared to other pretrained models obtained from the ParlAI framework.

    "paper_summary": "The authors present a strong method for unsupervised constituency parsing that relies on RoBERTa and constituent classification based on an initial set of constituents / distuents. Throughout training, this labeled set is updated with the models own predictions. Extensive results and analysis show the competitiveness of this approach with other unsupervised parsing methods. That being said, some details needed for reproducibility are needed, and claims about the initial set being a “minor” source of supervision are contradicted throughout the text.\nTo clarify the last part above, the issue may be that “minor” is underspecified. Clearly their supervision is relatively easy to acquire, although it appears their approach is sensitive to choice of initial labeled set. ",
    "strengths": "- Simple yet effective method for unsupervised constituency parsing that is EM-like. Competitive with existing models.\n- Provides additional value through interesting ablations and extensive analysis. ",
    "weaknesses": "- It is not clear what effect the initial set of candidate constituents and distuents has on final performance. Multiple times the authors claim this form of supervision is “minimal”, and although it is certainly simple to use, perhaps different initial sets would yield different results. Based on Appendix A.1 it does seem like several ways of exploring initial set were explored, although no results reported. There are some results with this respect in section 5.3 showing that left-branching and random strategies to build initial seed set yield very low performance, and authors also state “the manner in which we perform the initial classification has a strong impact on the final tree structure” here. It would greatly help to be more consistent about the effect of the initial seed set throughout the text.\n- It’s not clear how h_in(i, j) and h_out(i, j) are computed. For h_in, two likely possibilities are: a) RoBERTa is run over only the tokens i:j and the last vector is used to represent the phrase, or b) RoBERTa is run over an entire sentence x, and two or more output vectors are concatenated to get phrase vectors. If (a) is used, this seems clean although a bit expensive. If (b) is used, it seems like this would have trouble distinguishing between inside and outside. In either case, the text should be more clear about how this is done otherwise reproducibility would be quite difficult. ",
    "comments": "- Do you think that validation using performance on the dev set (using early stopping or hyperparam selection) would be helpful? There are many reasons why people are interested in methods that could benefit from validation (even for unsupervised learning) because it can help find a model with a good inductive bias that does not overfit to given labels. I suppose by reporting three settings (inside, inside w/ self-training, inside + outside) you are doing a type of validation over hyperparams.  - Do you think your method of seed bootstrapping would be generally applicable to other types of unsupervised parsing models?\n- What does it mean to re-normalize class probability scores in Fig 3?\n- How much does the set of labels grow each epoch?\n- How did you choose min/max threshold values, and what are these values? Also, how did you decide 1:10 ratio of constituents to distituents? ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper presents a new dataset called FairytaleQA, which consists of 10,580 expert-annotated questions from 278 children-friendly stories. One key feature of this dataset is that each question is annotated with the specific reading comprehension skill required to answer it. The authors run several versions of BART-based QA models to show that the model cannot obtain human performance. Additionally, they use FairytaleQA for training question generation models and show that it can be used to ask high-quality reading comprehension questions. ",
    "strengths": "- This paper introduces a reasonable-sized dataset for QA in narratives. The dataset (if available) would be a useful resource for the NLP community.  - A good review of existing datasets that focused on stories and narratives. It covers all the related datasets that I am aware of.  - The categorization of reading comprehension skills in Section 3.2 is useful.  - The paper is fairly easy to follow. ",
    "weaknesses": "- One major concern is that the contribution of this paper to the QA and NLP community seems mediocre. To me, the difference between FairytaleQA and other reading comprehension datasets on stories and narratives is not obvious. Although the additional annotations about reading skills could be counted as one highlight, this categorization is still coarse-grained to me since it seems nothing more than question types (I assume the categorization might be easily inferred from the question surface form, e.g., \"How did ... feel?\" belongs to the \"Feeling\" category).  - Some details of the annotation process are still vague to me. In Line 342, it claims that the \"texts were broken down into small sections based on their semantic content by our annotators.\" The annotation details for this part seems not revealed. For the question annotation, how many annotators work for each article? What is the detailed annotation guideline? How many questions are required for each article? How the annotators are paid? How to avoid annotation bias?\n- Another worrying fact is that: from Table 5, we see the performance gap between the QA model and the human is not very big. The BART model fine-tuned on FairytaleQA is 0.533 Rouge and 0.536 F1, which is already around 82% of the human performance (0.651 / 0.644). This suggests that FairytaleQA might not be challenging enough. The possibility is that, with some additional engineering efforts on the QA model, FairytaleQA becomes yet another QA dataset that gets solved within a matter of weeks that does not truly evaluate the phenomena it sets out to. ",
    "comments": "Minor Suggestions:  - I think explicit and implicit questions might not be a good naming. Factual detail questions and inductive questions might be more clear?

Otherwise, it might become yet another incremental reading comprehension dataset that might be addressed within a couple of months. ",

    "paper_summary": "This paper proposed a hierarchical recurrent aggregation framework to reduce the few-shot NLG task. The proposed framework consists of three modules, lexicalization, aggregation, and post-editing, which are composed of PLMs and do not share parameters.

    "strengths": "The method performs better than the compared baseline under low-resource settings, especially for MER metrics. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. ** Poor efficiency**. The proposed method contains three different modules, each containing an unshared PLM so that the amount of parameters is three times that of the End2End method. As T5 is good at multi-task learning, I think the author should consider how to improve the performance of the model in the case of parameter sharing, rather than simply stacking multiple models. \n2. ** Time-consuming**. The proposed method requires recurrent generation so that the speed of response generation will be significantly reduced, especially when the amount of attribute-value pairs is relatively large. It should be noted that the NLG model is only a part of the dialogue system of the pipeline structure, and time efficiency also needs to be taken into consideration. \n3. ** Lack of strong baselines**. The baseline for comparison is only E2E-T5, which is a naive E2E-NLG method and may not be strong enough. Therefore, the improvement of the proposed method over a single T5 model(E2E-T5) may not be a very valuable conclusion.  I think the author should investigate and compare more few-shot NLG methods to enhance the persuasiveness of the experimental results. \n4.

    "paper_summary": "The paper is about an unsupervised approach to sentence simplification that integrates paraphrasing into an iterative text simplification system. The authors start with an iterative framework in which an input sentence is revised using two edit operations: delete and paraphrase. For deletion, the system uses the constituency tree of the input sentence to obtain all constituents from different depths of the parse tree, and new candidate sentences are created by removing each of these phrases from the input sentence. For paraphrasing, the system uses lexically-constrained decoding, by identifying \"complex components\" in the input - which, in turn, is done by training a text complexity classifier whose attention head matrices in the second layer are used to perform the complex word identification. Candidate sentences generated by these edit operations are then filtered using a score function on the basis of grammaticality, simplicity, and semantic similarity. ",
    "strengths": "1. The approach is interesting, simple, and easy to understand - combining edit-operation-based and paraphrasing-based techniques into an iterative refinement framework. It is a hybrid between seq2seq generative modeling and explicit edit-based modeling and tries to leverage the strengths of these different groups of modeling techniques. \n2. Unsupervised system - different components (models and datasets) can be replaced, which makes the system less dependent on pairwise-annotated datasets. \n3. Interpretability and controllability - these are quite impactful characteristics of the system. ",
    "weaknesses": "1. Human evaluations were not performed. Given the weaknesses of SARI (Vásquez-Rodríguez et al. 2021) and FKGL (Tanprasert and Kauchak, 2021), the lack of human evaluations severely limits the potential impact of the results, combined with the variability in the results on different datasets. \n2. While the authors explain the need to include text generation models into the framework of (Kumar et al., 2020), it is not clear as to why only the delete operation was retained from the framework, which used multiple edit operations (reordering, deletion, lexical simplification, etc.). Further, it is not clear how including those other operations will affect the quality and performance of the system. \n3. ( minor) It is unclear how the authors arrived at the different components of the \"scoring function,\" nor is it clear how they arrived at the different threshold values/ranges. \n4. Finally, one might wonder that the performance gains on Newsela are due to a domain effect, given that the system was explicitly tuned for deletion operations (that abound in Newsela) and that performance is much lower on the ASSET test corpus. It is unclear how the system would generalize to new datasets with varying levels of complexity, and peripheral content. ",
    "comments": "1. Is there any reason why 'Gold Reference' was not reported for Newsela? It makes it hard to assess the performance of the existing system.   2. Similarly, is there a reason why the effect of linguistic acceptability was not analyzed (Table 3 and Section 4.6)? \n3. It will be nice to see some examples of the system on actual texts (vs. other components & models). \n4. What were the final thresholds that were used for the results? It will also be good for reproducibility if the authors can share the full set of hyperparameters as well. ",
