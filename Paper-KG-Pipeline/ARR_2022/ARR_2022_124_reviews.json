    "paper_summary": "This paper proposes a conversation-based VQA (Co-VQA) framework to decompose a complex question into a sequence of sub-questions and get the final result by answering the sub-questions. \nThe Co-VQA contains three components: Questioner, Oracle, and Answerer, to decompose the question, provide oracle answers in the training procedure and perform reasoning model on the sequence of sub-questions seperately. \nBut there are several dependancies (e.g. SQS, Oracle) that bound the performance of the proposed model. ",
    "strengths": "The author introduces an interactive mechanism into the VQA task. ",
    "weaknesses": "- What is the percentage of complex questions in the VQA dataset ? If the proportion is very small, it is really hard for the proposed method to gain significant improvement.\n- There are several dependancies (e.g. SQS, Oracle) that bound the performance of the proposed model.\n- The improvement of Table 1 and 2 is not significant. If the author insists on the significancy of those performance, please provide corresponding statistical analysis, like p-value. ",
    "comments": "N/A ",
    "overall_score": "3 = Good: This paper is of interest to the *ACL audience and could be published, but might not be appropriate for a top-tier publication venue. It would likely be a strong paper in a suitable workshop.",
    "confidence": "3 =  Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math or experimental design."
