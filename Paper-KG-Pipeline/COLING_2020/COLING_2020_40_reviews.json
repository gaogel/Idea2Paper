    "strengths": "- A simple method to incorporate traditional features that is shown to improve neural scoring models quite significantly (p-value < 0.05).",
    "weaknesses": "- There's no comparison with existing work, or the state-of-the-art in the topic, especially the DNN-based ones which are listed in the related work section (Sec 2.3 and 2.4).\n- The study on handcrafted essay features is not eye-opening, Table 5 only suggests that \"each handcrafted feature contributes to some extent\". It would be better if a comprehensive ablation study was conducted, to understand which traditional features contribute the most (and the least), especially given the BERT pretrained models for encoding.",
