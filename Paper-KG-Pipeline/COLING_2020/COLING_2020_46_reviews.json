    "strengths": "- extensive experiment section which assesses separately the role of sharing each component of the network between the two tasks (word embeddings, bi-lstm layers, tree-lstm).\n- strong empirical results: the mtl system obtains a substantial improvement over the baseline - excellent writing: the description of the proposal is very clear and motivated.",
    "weaknesses": "- final test results only provide the baseline and the proposed system. For additional context, I would have appreciated having the current best published results for both datasets in a comparable setting (supervised system, no pretraining), and overall.",
