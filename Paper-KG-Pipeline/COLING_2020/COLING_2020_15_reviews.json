    "comments": "This paper presents a method for semantic role labelling based on the integration of syntactic information coming from heterogenous syntactic representations. More precisely, the proposal consists in extracting dependency information from treebanks using what authors call different annotation guidelines. It seems to me that there is at this stage a misunderstanding: the difference between the different treebanks mentioned in the paper relies on different formalisms, some are phrase-structure, others are dependency based. Moreover, there is no precise motivation of the reasons for doing that. There exists for example algorithms for generating homogeneous dependency-based representations from other formalisms. Nothing is said about the type of representation that can be extracted with this approach. The authors propose to join explicit and implicit methods for heterogenous parsing. The same type of problem appears there: it is not clear how heterogeneity is taken into account, the nature of the nodes being totally different depending on the representation. An experiment is presented, but the discussion does not propose an analysis of the observed improvements. The paper is not well organized and remains often obscure. It is not well motivated and does not really explains the impact of the method.",
