    "strengths": "- Interesting new dataset - both for new phenomena, and a language pair with limited resources for this type of evaluation - Solid evaluation using the new dataset, to come to interesting conclusions about a range of NMT techniques I think \"brand-new solution\" is a bit of over-selling your point. The work that you mentioned are related to yours, and share some aspects. So I think you can phrase this a bit differently.\nIt is not clear to me if there is always one phenomena per sentence, or if there can be more. Can you please specify!\nIn 5.1 I think you mean an improvement of 1.2 Bleu points, not 1.7 (DeepL vs Google), or otherwise I misunderstood the comparison.\nSection 6 has a weird title: \"Discussion\", which implies that it contains a discussion of the previous parts. I would call it something actually related to the contents of the section, like \"correlation with human evaluation\".\nPlease provide a reference to the robustness shared task when it is first mentioned in the introduction.\nThere are some grammatical issues, here are issues from the abstract: \"plentiful of noises\" -> \"considerable noise\" \"these input\" -> \"these types of input/expressions\" \"Though its importance being recognized\" -> \"Though its importance has been recognized\"",
