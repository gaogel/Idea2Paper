    "strengths": "The motivation of this paper is clear, i.e., to solve the problem that \"What would be the best generic ALD ...\", as described at the beginning of paragraph 2, section 1. The generic abusive language typology is categorised as two aspects, i.e., target aspect and content aspect, and multi-aspect embedding layer considers embeddings of both target and content, followed by cross-attention gate flow to refine four types of embeddings. The proposed model outperforms baselines on all the seven datasets. Detailed ablation studies have been given in section 5 as well.",
    "weaknesses": "For the structure of the paper, section 4 can be integrated into section 5 as a sub-section.\nthe description of baselines in section 4 is too detailed, which should be refined and shortened appropriately.\nThe paragraph 3, section 5.1 can be titled as a sub-section called \"case study\" since this paragraph analyzes some prediction examples in Table 3.",
